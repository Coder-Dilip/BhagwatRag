{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) task. The prompt is asking a model to generate a philosophical summary of a given set of data, specifically related to the concept of \"DEVOTION\". The summary should reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the concept and its relationships, while also resolving any contradictions and maintaining a coherent narrative.\n\nThe prompt provides some guidelines for the model to follow:\n\n1. Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n2. Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n3. Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n4. If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe data provided includes two entities (\"DEVOTION\") and a list of descriptions related to these entities. The model is expected to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nThe output expected is a written summary in third person, which reflects the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the concept of devotion, while also maintaining a coherent narrative and providing full context.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"DEVOTION\"\nDescription List: [\"Devotion, a virtue that guides one towards spiritual growth\", \"Devotional service is the path to spiritual growth and self-realization\", \"The concept of devotion to Krishna, mentioned as the supreme instruction\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
