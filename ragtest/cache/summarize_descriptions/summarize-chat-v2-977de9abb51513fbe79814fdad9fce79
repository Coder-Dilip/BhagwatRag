{"result": "This is a Python script that defines a prompt for a coding challenge or AI model training exercise. The prompt is inspired by the Bhagavad Gita and asks the model to generate a profound, philosophical summary of a given entity and its related descriptions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the prompt:\n\n1. The model is tasked with synthesizing a given list of descriptions related to an entity, which in this case is \"COMPASSION\".\n2.

The summary should maintain a coherent narrative, written in third person, and include the entity names to provide full context.\n5. The prompt mentions specific concepts from the Bhagavad Gita, such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, and asks the model to interpret the descriptions in a way that highlights their deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe script provides an example of the expected input and output, with the input being the entity \"COMPASSION\" and a list of descriptions, and the output being a philosophical summary that captures the essence of the entity and its related themes.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"COMPASSION\"\nDescription List: [\"A virtue that causes Arjuna emotional turmoil on the battlefield\", \"Compassion is a virtue that causes Arjuna emotional turmoil on the battlefield\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
