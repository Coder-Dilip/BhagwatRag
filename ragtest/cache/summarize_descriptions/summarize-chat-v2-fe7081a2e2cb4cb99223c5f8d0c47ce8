{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) model, specifically designed for generating a profound and philosophical summary inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita. The prompt outlines the task requirements, data structure, and expected output.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the prompt defines:\n\n**Task**: The model is tasked with generating a summary of a given set of descriptions related to one or two entities, with the goal of capturing both literal and symbolic meanings.\n\n**Data structure**: The input data consists of:\n\n1. **Entities**: A list of entity names, in this case, \"ABSOLUTE TRUTH\".\n2. **Description list**: A list of descriptions related to the entity(ies), in this case, a list of five descriptions that define the concept of the Absolute Truth from various perspectives.\n\n**Output format**: The expected output is a summary written in third person, which:\n\n1. Reflects on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n2. Resolves any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles of the Bhagavad Gita.\n3. Maintains a coherent narrative.\n4. Includes the entity names to provide full context.\n\n**Additional guidelines**: The prompt also provides additional guidelines, such as:\n\n1. To emphasize concepts like duty, virtue, the self, and the soul when interpreting the descriptions.\n2. To highlight the deeper spiritual significance of the concepts described.\n\nOverall, this prompt definition file is designed to challenge the NLP model to generate a sophisticated and thought-provoking summary that not only summarizes the given data but also applies philosophical and spiritual principles to provide a richer understanding of the concepts involved.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"ABSOLUTE TRUTH\"\nDescription List: [\"\", \"The Absolute Truth is the complete whole that comprises the supreme controller, the controlled living entities, the cosmic manifestation, eternal time, and karma\", \"The concept of the Absolute Truth, which can be perceived by the conditioned soul in the human form of life\", \"The concept of the ultimate reality, beyond conditional existence\", \"The ultimate reality that is the objective of devotional sacrifice and transcendental activities\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
