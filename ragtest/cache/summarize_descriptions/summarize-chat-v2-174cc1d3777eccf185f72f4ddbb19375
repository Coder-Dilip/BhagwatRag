{"result": "This appears to be a prompt definition file for a AI model, specifically designed to generate a philosophical summary inspired by the Bhagavad Gita. The prompt provides guidance on how to generate a summary, including:\n\n1. Reflecting on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n2. Resolving any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles of the Bhagavad Gita.\n3. Ensuring the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n4. Highlighting concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, and interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe prompt also provides a specific dataset to work with, which includes two entities (\"WOMEN\", \"RSYASRNGA\") and a list of descriptions related to these entities. The AI model is expected to generate a summary that synthesizes these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nOverall, this prompt definition file is designed to evaluate the AI model's ability to understand and apply philosophical concepts, as well as its capacity to generate coherent and insightful summaries based on a given dataset.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: [\"WOMEN\", \"RSYASRNGA\"]\nDescription List: [\"Rsyasrnga is controlled by women, illustrating the power of attraction\", \"Women distract Rsysrnga from his spiritual pursuits\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
