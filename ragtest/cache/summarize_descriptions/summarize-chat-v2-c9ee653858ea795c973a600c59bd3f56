{"result": "This is a Python script that defines a prompt for generating a profound, philosophical summary of data inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita. The script includes a detailed description of the prompt, the entities to be considered, and the expected output format.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the script:\n\n1. The first line is a copyright notice and license statement from Microsoft Corporation, indicating that the script is licensed under the MIT License.\n2. The script defines a string constant `SUMMARIZE_PROMPT` that contains the prompt itself. The prompt is a lengthy block of text that outlines the task and expected output for generating a philosophical summary.\n3. The prompt is divided into several sections:\n\t* The first section provides an overview of the task and the entity being summarized, Dvaraka.\n\t* The second section outlines the expected content of the summary:\n\t\t+ Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n\t\t+ Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita.\n\t\t+ Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n\t\t+ If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\t* The third section provides the specific data to be summarized: the entities \"Dvaraka\", and a list of descriptions.\n\n4. The script does not include any code to actually generate the summary. Instead, it provides a template for generating a philosophical summary based on the provided data.\n\nOverall, this script defines a prompt for generating a philosophical summary of data inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita, and provides a detailed description of the expected output format.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"DVARAKA\"\nDescription List: [\"\", \"Dvaraka is a city in the text where the demigods beheld the wonderful form of Sri Krsna)Additional Relationships:(\\\"relationship\\\"\", \"Dvaraka is the holy city of the Yadu dynasty\", \"Dvaraka, the city of Lord Krsna's opulence>\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
