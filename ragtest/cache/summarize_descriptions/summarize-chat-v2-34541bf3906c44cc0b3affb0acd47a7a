The model is tasked with generating a summary of one or two entities and a list of descriptions related to those entities.\n2. The summary should capture both the literal and symbolic meanings of the descriptions.\n3. The model should reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n4. The model should resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita.\n5. The summary should be written in third person and include the entity names to provide full context.\n6. The model should emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe prompt also provides an example dataset, which includes:\n\n1. Entities: \"LIVING ENTITY\" and \"MATERIAL NATURE\"\n2.
