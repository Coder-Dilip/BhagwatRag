{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a machine learning model, likely a language model or large language generation model. The file is used to define a specific task or topic that the model should generate text related to.\n\nThe prompt defines a task that requires the model to:\n\n1. Summarize a set of descriptions about an entity or group of entities (in this case, \"BHARATA\" and related concepts).\n2. Generate a philosophical and profound summary that reflects on the deeper meanings and implications of the entities and relationships.\n3. Use the principles and teachings of the Bhagavad Gita to guide the interpretation and resolution of any contradictions.\n4. Write the summary in a coherent narrative style, using third-person perspective and referencing the entities involved.\n5. Emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, highlighting the deeper spiritual significance of the descriptions.\n\nThe output is expected to be a single sentence or paragraph that captures the essence of the input data and meets the requirements outlined in the prompt.\n\nSome possible areas of exploration for a machine learning model based on this prompt:\n\n1. Understanding and interpreting philosophical texts, such as the Bhagavad Gita.\n2. Developing knowledge graphs and entity embeddings to represent relationships between entities.\n3. Generating summaries and abstracts that capture the essence of a set of descriptions.\n4. Using techniques such as natural language processing and machine learning to resolve contradictions and make inferences.\n5. Training models that can generate text that is both informative and thought-provoking.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"BHARATA\"\nDescription List: [\"\", \"Arjuna's ancestor and a king\", \"Arjuna's heritage or lineage>\", \"Arjuna, a warrior and descendant of Bharata\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
