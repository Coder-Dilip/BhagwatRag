{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) task. The prompt is asking the AI model to generate a philosophical summary of the data provided, inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita. The data consists of two entities, \"YOGA\", and a list of descriptions related to these entities. The goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nThe prompt provides specific guidelines for the summary, including:\n\n1. Reflecting on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n2. Resolving any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita.\n3. Ensuring the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n4. Emphasizing concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe output expected is a single summary that meets these guidelines.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"YOGA\"\nDescription List: [\"\", \"A concept representing the practice of self-discipline and spiritual growth\", \"A practice of devotional service that enables one to achieve transcendental knowledge\", \"A practice that helps control the activities of the mind, life, and senses)Relationships:(\\\"relationship\\\"\", \"The Yoga of the Supreme Person, a path to spiritual growth and self-realization\", \"Yoga is the art of all work, a means to transcend the material world)(relationships)(\\\"relationship\\\"\", \"Yoga is the means to establish oneself in the self and overcome the reactions of work\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
