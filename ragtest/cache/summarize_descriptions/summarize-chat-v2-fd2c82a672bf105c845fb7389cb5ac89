{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) task. The prompt is asking a model to generate a philosophical summary of a given entity (in this case, \"DEATH\") based on a list of descriptions. The summary should reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entity and relationships, and should be written in a coherent narrative style.\n\nThe prompt provides some guidelines for the model to follow:\n\n* Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n* Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita.\n* Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n* If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe prompt also provides an example of the input data, which includes:\n\n* Entities: \"DEATH\"\n* Description List: [\"\", \"The concept of death as a natural part of the cycle of creation\"]\n\nThe output expected is a summary that synthesizes the descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings of the entity.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"DEATH\"\nDescription List: [\"\", \"The concept of death as a natural part of the cycle of creation\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
