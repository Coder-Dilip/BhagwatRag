{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a text summarization task. The prompt is based on the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture.\n\nThe prompt describes a hypothetical AI assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided. The data consists of one or two entities and a list of descriptions related to the same entity or group of entities.\n\nThe goal is to synthesize the descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings. The summary should:\n\n1. Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n2. Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n3. Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n4. If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe specific example provided is for the entity \"SELF\", with a list of three descriptions related to its true nature or essence. The expected output is a philosophical summary that captures the essence of these descriptions in a coherent and insightful narrative.\n\nOverall, this prompt definition is a great example of a complex text summarization task that requires the AI model to not only understand the literal meaning of the text but also to apply philosophical and spiritual concepts to generate a meaningful summary.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"SELF\"\nDescription List: [\"A concept referring to the true nature of an individual, beyond the physical and material realm\", \"The individual's true nature or essence, often referred to as the \\\"self\\\"\", \"The self is the individual self who is expanded everywhere and is situated within the Supreme Personality of Godhead>\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
