The prompt is asking the model to generate a philosophical summary of a given set of data, inspired by the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. The data consists of one or two entities and a list of descriptions related to those entities.\n\nThe goal is to synthesize the descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings. The summary should reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships, and ensure that the narrative is coherent and written in third person.\n\nSome specific requirements for the summary are:\n\n1. Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n2. Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita.\n3. Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n4. If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe output format is also specified, with a prompt that includes the data and a neutral title (\"Summary Prompt\").", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: [\"LIVING_ENTITY\", \"SUPREME_PERSONALITY_OF_GODHEAD\"]\nDescription List: [\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead perfectly understands His own position and that of the living entity, represented by the eating bird\", \"The living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but due to ignorance, it does not understand its own position or the Lord's\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
