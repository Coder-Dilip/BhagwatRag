{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) task. The prompt is asking a model to generate a philosophical summary of a given dataset, inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita. The summary should reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships, and should be written in a coherent narrative in the third person.\n\nThe prompt provides specific guidelines for the summary, including:\n\n* Reflecting on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships\n* Resolving any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita\n* Ensuring the summary maintains a coherent narrative\n* Including the entity names to provide full context\n* Emphasizing concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, and interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance\n\nThe prompt also provides a specific example of the type of data that the model should be able to process, including two entities (\"Pṛthā\" and \"Pandu\") and a list of descriptions related to those entities. The output should be a summary that synthesizes the descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nOverall, this prompt definition file is asking the model to generate a thoughtful and insightful summary that goes beyond simply listing the facts and instead provides a deeper understanding of the entities and relationships.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"P\\u1e5aTH\\u0100\"\nDescription List: [\"Arjuna's father, Pṛthā\", \"Arjuna's father, who is also known as Pandu\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
