The model's task is to generate a profound, philosophical summary of the data.\n2. The data consists of one or two entities and a list of descriptions related to those entities.\n3. The goal is to synthesize the descriptions into a single summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n4. The summary should reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n5. The summary should resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles of the Bhagavad Gita.\n6. The summary should be written in third person and include the entity names to provide full context.\n7. If relevant, the summary should emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe prompt also provides an example of the data and the expected output format. The data consists of an entity named \"SUN\" and a list of descriptions, and the expected output is a philosophical summary that reflects on the symbolic and spiritual significance of the sun.\n\nOverall, this prompt definition file provides a clear and specific task for the model to generate a philosophical summary of the given data, while also providing guidance on the tone, style, and content of the summary.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"SUN\"\nDescription List: [\"A symbol of light, life, and nourishment\", \"The Sun is a deity associated with light and warmth\", \"The concept of the sun as a symbol of light and radiance>\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
