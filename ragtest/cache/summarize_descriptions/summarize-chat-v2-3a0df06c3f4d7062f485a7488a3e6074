{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) task, specifically a summarization task. The prompt is designed to guide the AI model in generating a profound and philosophical summary of the given data.\n\nThe prompt is inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian text that explores themes of spirituality, morality, and philosophy. The model is tasked with synthesizing descriptions related to two entities, \"KRSNA\" and \"BRAHMANAS'\", and generating a summary that reflects the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of these entities and their relationships.\n\nThe output expected from the model is a summary that:\n\n1. Reflects on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n2. Resolves any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n3. Maintains a coherent narrative written in third person and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n4. If relevant, emphasizes concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe given data includes two entities, \"KRSNA\" and \"BRAHMANAS'\", along with a list of descriptions related to these entities. The model is expected to generate a summary that captures the essence of these descriptions and provides a profound and philosophical interpretation of the relationships between the entities.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: [\"KRSNA\", \"BRAHMANAS'\"]\nDescription List: [\"Krsna is affected by the Brahmanas' curse\", \"Krsna is unable to counteract the Brahmanas' curse\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
