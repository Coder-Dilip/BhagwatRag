{"result": "It looks like you provided a code snippet with a commentary on a file containing prompts definition. This file seems to define a PROMPT for a specific task, which is to summarize a given dataset inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n\nThe PROMPT provides specific guidelines for the generated summary:\n\n1. Synthesize the descriptions into a single, insightful summary.\n2. Reflect on philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n3. Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, aligning with the teachings and principles of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n4. Use third-person narrative and include entity names for context.\n5. Emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, self, and soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nFinally, the code snippet specifies a data structure with two entities (\"ATMAN\" and \"PARAMATMAN\") and a list of descriptions related to these entities. The expected output is a single, profound philosophical summary.\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like to know or discuss about this PROMPT or the task it defines?", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: [\"ATMAN\", \"PARAMATMAN\"]\nDescription List: [\"Paramatman and atman are connected, and the ultimate goal is to connect with paramatman\", \"The paramatman is connected to the atman, and a yogi seeks to connect with this higher reality\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
