{"result": "This is a Python file that defines a prompt for a natural language processing (NLP) model to generate a summary based on a set of descriptions related to a specific entity, in this case, \"MIND\". The prompt is inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian text that explores the nature of the self, duty, and the relationship between the individual and the universe.\n\nThe prompt provides specific guidelines for the summary generation task:\n\n1. Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n2. Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita.\n3. Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n4. If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe data section provides the entities (\"MIND\") and a list of descriptions related to the entity. The output section specifies the expected format of the generated summary.\n\nOverall, this prompt is designed to test the NLP model's ability to generate a meaningful and insightful summary that not only summarizes the given data but also provides a deeper understanding of the concept of \"MIND\" in the context of the Bhagavad Gita's teachings.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"MIND\"\nDescription List: [\"A person's mind is distracted by attachment to material possessions and desires>\", \"Mind is performed without material desire, indicating detachment from worldly attachments\", \"The mind is one of the senses, often depicted as a source of thought and consciousness\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
