{"result": "A fascinating prompt! It appears to be a philosophical summarization challenge, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*. The goal is to synthesize a list of descriptions related to two entities, \"MAYA\" and \"DHARMA\", into a profound and insightful summary that captures both literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nThe prompt provides guidance on what to include in the summary:\n\n1. Reflecting on philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n2. Resolving contradictions thoughtfully, aligning with *Bhagavad Gita*'s teachings and principles.\n3. Maintaining a coherent narrative written in third person, with entity names for context.\n4. Emphasizing concepts like duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, highlighting deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe provided data includes the two entities and a list of descriptions, which are:\n\n1. \"Maya hides the true nature of dharma, leading to confusion and misguidance\"\n2. \"Maya is the illusion that can lead to the decline of Dharma\"\n\nThe expected output is a summary that meets the above guidelines, which will likely involve interpreting the descriptions in a way that reveals deeper spiritual significance and connections between the two entities. This challenge requires a thoughtful and philosophical approach to understanding the relationships between Maya and Dharma.\n\nI'm excited to see how this prompt is addressed!", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: [\"MAYA\", \"DHARMA\"]\nDescription List: [\"Maya hides the true nature of dharma, leading to confusion and misguidance\", \"Maya is the illusion that can lead to the decline of Dharma\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
