{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) task. It outlines the requirements for generating a summary of a given dataset, specifically entities and their descriptions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the prompt:\n\n* The prompt is inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian Hindu scripture that explores philosophical and spiritual concepts.\n* The task is to generate a profound and philosophical summary of the data, which consists of one or two entities and a list of descriptions related to the same entity or group of entities.\n* The summary should capture both the literal and symbolic meanings of the entities and relationships between them.\n* The prompt provides specific guidelines for the summary:\n\t+ Reflect on philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n\t+ Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\t+ Ensure the summary is written in third person and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n\t+ Emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n* The prompt also specifies the format of the output, which is the generated summary.\n\nIn this specific case, the entities are \"LOVE\" and \"AFFECTION\", and the description list consists of two descriptions about the relationship between these entities and the actions of parent birds. The output the model should generate is a summary that captures the philosophical and spiritual implications of these entities and relationships, written in a coherent and insightful narrative.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: [\"LOVE\", \"AFFECTION\"]\nDescription List: [\"Love and affection are closely related concepts that drive the parent birds' actions\", \"Love and affection are intertwined emotions that strengthen the bond between the parent birds\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
