{"result": "It seems like this is a code snippet for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that aims to generate a summary of a given set of data. The summary is supposed to be inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita, a Hindu scripture.\n\nThe system is provided with a set of data, which includes:\n\n* Two entities: \"VEDAS\" and \"VEDANTA\"\n* A list of descriptions related to these entities:\n\t+ \"The Vedas are a source of knowledge and wisdom that can help understand the nature of the Supreme Being\"\n\t+ \"The Vedas contain the teachings of Vedanta\"\n\t+ \"Vedas are the basis for the philosophical school of Vedanta\"\n\nThe system's goal is to generate a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings of the data. The summary should:\n\n* Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships\n* Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita\n* Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context\n* If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance\n\nThe output of the system is expected to be a single, profound, and philosophical summary that captures the essence of the data.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: [\"VEDAS\", \"VEDANTA\"]\nDescription List: [\"The Vedas are a source of knowledge and wisdom that can help understand the nature of the Supreme Being\", \"The Vedas contain the teachings of Vedanta\", \"Vedas are the basis for the philosophical school of Vedanta\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
