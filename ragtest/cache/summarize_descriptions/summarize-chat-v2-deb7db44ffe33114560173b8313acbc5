{"result": "This is a Python script that defines a prompt for a AI application, specifically for generating a philosophical summary inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita. The script outlines the task, provides guidelines for the summary, and includes sample data for the entities and descriptions to be summarized.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the script:\n\n1. It starts by declaring the copyright and licensing information.\n2. The main part of the script defines a string constant `SUMMARIZE_PROMPT` that contains the prompt description. This prompt explains the task, provides guidelines for the summary, and includes the sample data.\n3. The prompt is structured as follows:\n\t* It explains the task and the inspiration from the Bhagavad Gita.\n\t* It provides guidelines for the summary, including reflecting on philosophical and moral implications, resolving contradictions, and maintaining a coherent narrative.\n\t* It emphasizes the importance of entity names and concepts like duty, virtue, the self, and the soul.\n4. The script includes sample data for the entities and descriptions to be summarized. In this case, the entity is \"KNOWER\", and the description list includes four descriptions.\n5. The prompt ends with an `Output` section, which is likely where the AI application would generate the summary based on the provided data.\n\nOverall, this script provides a clear and specific prompt for an AI application to generate a philosophical summary inspired by the Bhagavad Gita.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"KNOWER\"\nDescription List: [\"\", \"The concept of the knower or the self, which is the subject of knowledge\", \"The knower is the individual self or the soul that is aware of the material world\", \"The knower of the body is the soul that illuminates the entire body by consciousness\", \"The person or entity having knowledge or understanding\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
