{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) task. The prompt is asking the AI model to generate a philosophical summary of a given set of data related to the concept of \"NATURE\". The summary should reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships, and should be written in a coherent narrative style.\n\nThe prompt provides some guidelines for the AI model to follow:\n\n* Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n* Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita.\n* Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n* If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe data provided includes the entity \"NATURE\" and a list of descriptions related to it. The descriptions are:\n\n* \"Material nature and the living entities, beginningless and capable of transformation\"\n* \"Material nature, which is transcendental to the Absolute Truth\"\n* \"The inherent characteristics or tendencies of an individual, which can be influenced by the three modes of material nature\"\n* \"The material world and its modes of goodness, passion, and ignorance\"\n\nThe output expected is a philosophical summary that synthesizes these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"NATURE\"\nDescription List: [\"\", \"Material nature and the living entities, beginningless and capable of transformation\", \"Material nature, which is transcendental to the Absolute Truth\", \"The inherent characteristics or tendencies of an individual, which can be influenced by the three modes of material nature\", \"The material world and its modes of goodness, passion, and ignorance\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
