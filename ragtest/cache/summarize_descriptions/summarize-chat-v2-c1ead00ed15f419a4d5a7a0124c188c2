{"result": "This is a prompt definition file written in Python, likely for a natural language processing (NLP) or artificial intelligence (AI) model. The file is licensed under the MIT License and contains a prompt for a philosophical summary of a given dataset.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the prompt:\n\n1. The prompt explains the task: the model needs to generate a profound and philosophical summary of the provided data, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n2. The prompt defines the entities and descriptions: \"MATERIAL NATURE\" and \"LIVING ENTITY\" are the entities, and the description list contains two statements related to these entities.\n3. The prompt outlines the requirements for the summary:\n\t* Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n\t* Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n\t* Ensure the summary is written in third person, includes entity names for context, and maintains a coherent narrative.\n\t* If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n4. The prompt provides a template for the output, with placeholders for the summary.\n\nOverall, this prompt definition file provides a clear and specific task for the NLP/AI model, encouraging it to generate a thoughtful and philosophically insightful summary of the provided data.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: [\"MATERIAL NATURE\", \"LIVING ENTITY\"]\nDescription List: [\"Living entities are bound by the stringent laws of material nature\", \"The living entity follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
