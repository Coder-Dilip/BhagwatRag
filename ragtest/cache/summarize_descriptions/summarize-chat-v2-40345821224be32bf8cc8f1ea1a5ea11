{"result": "This is a code comment block, specifically a prompt definition, written in a Jupyter Notebook format. It appears to be a philosophical prompt for natural language processing tasks, such as text summarization.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the prompt:\n\n* The prompt introduces a hypothetical scenario where the AI assistant is tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of a given data set.\n* The data set consists of one or two entities (in this case, \"DEMI-GODS\") and a list of descriptions related to those entities.\n* The prompt outlines the requirements for the summary:\n\t+ Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n\t+ Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, incorporating principles from the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n\t+ Maintain a coherent narrative in third person, including entity names for context.\n\t+ Emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, within the interpretations.\n* The prompt provides a sample data set, which includes three descriptions related to the entity \"DEMI-GODS\".\n* The expected output is a philosophical summary that meets the requirements outlined in the prompt.\n\nThis prompt appears to be designed for a language model or AI assistant to generate a human-like summary that combines philosophical insight with technical intelligence.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"DEMI-GODS\"\nDescription List: [\"Deities who are mentioned in the text as being worshipped by those in the mode of goodness\", \"Demigods in heaven, who have a beginning and an end\", \"Divine beings worshipped for material success and prosperity\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
