{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) or machine learning model. The prompt is asking the model to generate a summary of the data provided, with a specific focus on the philosophical and spiritual themes related to the concept of \"KARMA\" from the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe model is expected to:\n\n1. Synthesize the descriptions into a single summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings of the concept of karma.\n2. Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships related to karma.\n3. Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found in the Bhagavad Gita.\n4. Maintain a coherent narrative, written in third person, and include the entity names to provide full context.\n5. Emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe data provided includes two entities (\"KARMA\") and a list of descriptions related to that entity. The model should use this data to generate the summary, which should be focused on the themes and principles of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe prompt is written in a clear and concise manner, with specific instructions and guidelines for the model to follow. It also includes a blank line (####) to separate the prompt from the data, which is a common practice in NLP and machine learning tasks.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"KARMA\"\nDescription List: [\"\", \"Activity, the result of an individual's actions, and the principle of cause and effect\", \"Karma refers to the activities of living entities that are governed by the laws of time and the Supreme Lord\", \"The concept of actions and reactions, which are governed by the law of karma and have an impact on the individual soul's journey and reincarnation\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
