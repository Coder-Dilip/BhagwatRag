{"result": "This is a prompt definition for a machine learning model, specifically a summarization model. The prompt defines a task for the model to generate a philosophical summary of a given dataset.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the prompt:\n\n1. **Context**: The model is a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*, a Hindu scripture.\n2. **Task**: Given one or two entities and a list of descriptions related to those entities, the model must synthesize the descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both literal and symbolic meanings.\n3. **Guidelines**:\n\t* Reflect on philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n\t* Resolve contradictions thoughtfully, aligning with *Bhagavad Gita* teachings and principles.\n\t* Maintain a coherent narrative in third person, including entity names for context.\n\t* Emphasize concepts like duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, highlighting deeper spiritual significance if relevant.\n4. **Data**: The prompt provides an example dataset,including:\n\t* Entities: \"WEALTH\"\n\t* Description List: a pair of descriptions related to wealth (false prestige and attachment, and accumulation through hard work and struggle)\n\nThe expected output is a summary that meets the guidelines and provides a profound, philosophical interpretation of the given data.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"WEALTH\"\nDescription List: [\"Wealth and material possessions that can lead to false prestige and attachment\", \"Wealth is a concept that can be accumulated through hard work and struggle>\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
