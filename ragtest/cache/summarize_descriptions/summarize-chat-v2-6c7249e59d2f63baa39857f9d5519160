{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a generative AI model, specifically designed to summarize a set of given data related to the concept of \"RAJAS\" from the perspective of the Bhagavad Gita. The prompt provides guidance on the key aspects to focus on while generating the summary:\n\n1. **Philosophical and spiritual insights**: The AI should reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships mentioned in the data.\n2. **Resolving contradictions**: The AI should resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita.\n3. **Coherent narrative**: The summary should be written in third person, include the entity names, and maintain a coherent narrative structure.\n4. **Emphasizing key concepts**: The AI should emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, when interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe specific requirements for the summary are:\n\n* Focus on the themes and implications of RAJAS, a state of mind characterized by passion, activity, and attachment.\n* Draw connections between the descriptions provided, highlighting any contradictions and resolving them thoughtfully.\n* Write a concise and coherent summary that reflects the AI's philosophical and spiritual insights.\n\nOverall, the prompt sets a clear standard for the AI model to generate a summary that not only summarizes the data but also provides a profound and philosophical interpretation of the concept of RAJAS from the perspective of the Bhagavad Gita.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"RAJAS\"\nDescription List: [\"A state of mind characterized by passion, activity, and attachment\", \"Rajas is a quality that cannot distinguish between right and wrong>\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
