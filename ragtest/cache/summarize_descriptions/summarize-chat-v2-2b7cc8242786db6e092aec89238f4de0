{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) task. The prompt is asking a model to generate a philosophical summary of a given dataset, inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita. The summary should reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships, and resolve any contradictions thoughtfully.\n\nThe prompt provides a specific structure for the output, including:\n\n* A coherent narrative written in third person\n* The inclusion of entity names to provide full context\n* Emphasis on concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, if relevant\n\nThe dataset consists of two entities, \"DVARAKA\" and \"BRAHMA\", and a list of descriptions related to these entities. The descriptions are:\n\n* \"Brahma goes to Dvaraka to visit Lord Krsna\"\n* \"Brahma is the creator of Dvaraka\"\n\nThe model is expected to generate a summary that synthesizes these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings. The summary should reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships, and resolve any contradictions thoughtfully.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: [\"DVARAKA\", \"BRAHMA\"]\nDescription List: [\"Brahma goes to Dvaraka to visit Lord Krsna\", \"Brahma is the creator of Dvaraka\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
