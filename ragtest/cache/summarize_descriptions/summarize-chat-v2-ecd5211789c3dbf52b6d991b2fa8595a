{"result": "It appears that this is a template for generating a philosophical summary, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*. The goal is to take a list of descriptions related to an entity (in this case, \"COMPASSION\") and distill them into a single, profound summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings of the entity.\n\nSome key points to note:\n\n1. The summary should reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n2. The summary should resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n3. The summary should maintain a coherent narrative, written in third person, and include the entity names to provide full context.\n4. The summary should emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, and interpret the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe example output is simply a placeholder, but it should provide a good starting point for generating a thoughtful and insightful summary.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"COMPASSION\"\nDescription List: [\"A virtue that causes Arjuna emotional turmoil on the battlefield\", \"Compassion is a virtue that causes Arjuna emotional turmoil on the battlefield\", \"Compassion, a virtue that causes inner conflict for Arjuna\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
