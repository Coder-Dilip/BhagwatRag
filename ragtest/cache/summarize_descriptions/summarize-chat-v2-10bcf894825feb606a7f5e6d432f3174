{"result": "This appears to be a prompt definition file for a AI model, specifically a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a philosophical summary based on the themes of the Bhagavad Gita. The prompt defines the goal and guidelines for the summary, including:\n\n* Reflecting on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships\n* Resolving contradictions in a way that aligns with the teachings and principles of the Bhagavad Gita\n* Maintaining a coherent narrative in third person, including the entity names for full context\n* Emphasizing concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, and interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance\n\nThe prompt also provides an example of data for the model to work with, including two entities (\"MATERIAL DESIRE\") and a list of descriptions that describe the entities. The example data is redundant, as the descriptions are identical.\n\nThe expected output of the model is a summary that meets the guidelines and reflects the philosophical and spiritual themes of the Bhagavad Gita.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"MATERIAL DESIRE\"\nDescription List: [\"Material desire is the cause of unhappiness and freedom from it is the cause of happiness\", \"Material desire is the cause of unhappiness and freedom from it is the cause of happiness>\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
