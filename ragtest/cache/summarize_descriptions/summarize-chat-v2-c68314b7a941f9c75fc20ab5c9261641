{"result": "It looks like you've shared a Python script with some text prompts and a data structure!\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The script starts with a copyright notice and a license statement, indicating that the author is granting permission to use the code under the terms of the MIT License.\n2. The script appears to be defining a prompt for a natural language processing (NLP) task. The prompt is asking for a summary of data provided about entities related to Vedic knowledge.\n3. The prompt is quite detailed, providing guidelines for the summary. It asks the AI to:\n\t* Generate a profound and philosophical summary inspired by the Bhagavad Gita.\n\t* Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n\t* Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\t* Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n\t* Highlight concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, and interpret the descriptions in a way that emphasizes deeper spiritual significance.\n4. The script provides sample data for the AI to work with. In this case, the entities are \"VEDIC KNOWLEDGE\", and there is a list of descriptions related to this entity. The descriptions include phrases like \"Vedic knowledge is received from transcendental sources and is perfect and all-pervading\" and \"Vedic knowledge is the authority that confirms Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead\".\n\nOverall, this script seems to be designed to assess the ability of an AI model to generate a thoughtful and philosophical summary of complex data, while also demonstrating an understanding of certain spiritual and philosophical concepts.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"VEDIC KNOWLEDGE\"\nDescription List: [\"Vedic knowledge is received from transcendental sources and is perfect and all-pervading\", \"Vedic knowledge is the authority that confirms Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
