{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a programming AI model, likely used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The file is licensed under the MIT License, and the copyright is held by Microsoft Corporation.\n\nThe prompt defines a specific task for the AI model: to generate a philosophical summary of a given dataset. The summary is based on the themes of the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian Hindu scripture.\n\nThe prompt provides the following guidelines for the AI model:\n\n1. The model is tasked with generating a summary of the data, inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita.\n2. The data consists of one or two entities (in this case, \"WOMEN\") and a list of descriptions related to those entities.\n3. The goal is to synthesize the descriptions into a single summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n4. The summary should reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n5. The model should resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita.\n6. The summary should maintain a coherent narrative, written in third person, and include the entity names to provide full context.\n7. If relevant, the model should emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe output expected from the AI model is a summary that meets these guidelines, incorporating the philosophical and symbolic themes of the Bhagavad Gita.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"WOMEN\"\nDescription List: [\"A symbol of temptation and distraction\", \"Female members of society, often associated with domestic duties and nurturing roles\", \"Women as objects of attraction and distraction\", \"Women, who receive sense gratification from men\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
