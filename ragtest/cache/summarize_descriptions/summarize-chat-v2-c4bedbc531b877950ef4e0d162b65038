{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a AI model that aims to generate a philosophical summary of a given dataset. The prompt is inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita, a Hindu scripture that discusses spiritual and philosophical concepts.\n\nThe prompt defines several requirements for the AI model's output:\n\n1. The summary should reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships described in the dataset.\n2. The model should resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita.\n3. The summary should maintain a coherent narrative, written in the third person, and include the entity names to provide full context.\n4. If relevant, the model should emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, and interpret the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe dataset provided includes two entities (\"KNOWLEDGE\") and a list of descriptions that relate to these entities. The AI model's task is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that meets the requirements mentioned above.\n\nThe prompt also includes a clear structure and format for the output, with a clear separation between the prompt, the dataset, and the expected output format. Overall, this prompt definition provides a clear direction and guideline for the AI model to generate a high-quality summary that meets the requirements of the task.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"KNOWLEDGE\"\nDescription List: [\"Real knowledge of the living entity is covered by lust\", \"The concept of knowledge, referring to understanding of the Absolute\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
