{"result": "This is a code file that defines a prompt for a natural language processing (NLP) task, specifically for generating a profound and philosophical summary of given data. The prompt is inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian text of Hinduism.\n\nThe prompt provides detailed instructions on what the system should do with the given data:\n\n1. Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n2. Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita.\n3. Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n4. If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe data provided includes:\n\n* Entities: \"TIME\", \"MODES_OF_NATURE\"\n* Description List: [\"Time influences the modes of nature, which in turn affect the living entity\", \"Time is governed by the cycles of creation and destruction influenced by the modes of nature\"]\n\nThe desired output is a summary that synthesizes these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings. The summary should reflect the philosophical and spiritual principles found in the Bhagavad Gita and provide a coherent narrative in third person.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: [\"TIME\", \"MODES_OF_NATURE\"]\nDescription List: [\"Time influences the modes of nature, which in turn affect the living entity\", \"Time is governed by the cycles of creation and destruction influenced by the modes of nature\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
