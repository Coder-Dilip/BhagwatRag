{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a programming challenge or AI model training exercise. The prompt is titled \"SUMMARIZE_PROMPT\" and is based on a philosophical and spiritual context, inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita. \n\nThe prompt describes a task where an AI model or algorithm is expected to generate a profound and philosophical summary of the given data. The data consists of entities (in this case, \"JIVA\") and a list of descriptions related to those entities. The AI model is tasked with synthesizing the descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nSome specific requirements of the summary are:\n\n1. Reflection on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n2. Resolution of any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita.\n3. Maintenance of a coherent narrative, written in third person, and inclusion of entity names to provide full context.\n4. Emphasis on concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe output is expected to be a single summary that meets these requirements. The prompt provides a clear outline of the task and the expected output, which can serve as a guideline for training or evaluating an AI model.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"JIVA\"\nDescription List: [\"The eternal, spiritual self or soul that is qualitatively one with the Lord>\", \"The individual living beings># Additional relationships\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
