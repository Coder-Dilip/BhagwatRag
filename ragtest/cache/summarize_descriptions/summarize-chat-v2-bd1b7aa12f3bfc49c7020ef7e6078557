{"result": "This is a Python script that defines a prompt for a natural language processing (NLP) task. The prompt is designed to test the ability of a language model to generate a philosophical summary of a given dataset.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the prompt:\n\n1. **Context**: The script provides some context about the entities and their relationships. In this case, the entities are \"NARAYANA\" and \"VAIKUNTHA\", and Vai-kuntha is described as the spiritual abode of Narayana.\n2. **Task**: The task is to summarize the descriptions provided in a way that reflects philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n3. **Requirements**: The script outlines several requirements for the summary:\n\t* Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n\t* Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, aligning with the teachings and principles of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\t* Maintain a coherent narrative written in third person.\n\t* Include entity names to provide full context.\n\t* Emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, highlighting deeper spiritual significance.\n4. **Data**: The script provides an example dataset with two entities and a list of descriptions related to those entities.\n\nThe goal of this prompt is to evaluate the ability of a language model to generate a comprehensive and insightful summary that not only conveys the literal meaning of the data but also reflects the deeper spiritual and philosophical insights associated with the entities and relationships.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: [\"NARAYANA\", \"VAIKUNTHA\"]\nDescription List: [\"Vaikuntha is the spiritual abode of Narayana\", \"Vaikuntha is the spiritual abode of Narayana, the true friend of all living beings\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
