The file defines a prompt for the system, which is used to summarize a given set of data.\n\nThe prompt consists of a detailed description of the task, including:\n\n1. A brief introduction to the Bhagavad Gita and its themes.\n2. A description of the task: to generate a summary of two entities (ARJUNA and BHARATA) and a list of descriptions related to these entities.\n3. Guidelines for the summary:\n\t* Reflect on philosophical, spiritual, and moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n\t* Resolve any contradictions in a thoughtful manner, aligning with the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\t* Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names for context.\n\t* Emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, highlighting deeper spiritual significance when relevant.\n4. An example of the input data, including the entities and descriptions, and an expected output.\n\nThe prompt is well-structured and provides a clear understanding of the task, making it easier for the NLP system to generate a high-quality summary. The use of specific guidelines and examples will help the system to produce a summary that is both accurate and coherent.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: [\"ARJUNA\", \"BHARATA\"]\nDescription List: [\"Arjuna is a descendant of Bharata and a warrior\", \"Arjuna's ancestry is a source of his identity and purpose\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
