{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) task. The prompt is asking a model to generate a philosophical summary of a given dataset, inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita. The goal is to synthesize the descriptions of one or two entities and their relationships into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nThe prompt provides specific guidelines for the summary, including:\n\n1. Reflecting on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n2. Resolving any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita.\n3. Ensuring the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n4. Emphasizing concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe specific dataset provided is related to the three modes of nature (sattva, rajas, and tamas) and their influence on living entities. The model is expected to generate a summary that captures the essence of this dataset, incorporating the philosophical and spiritual themes of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nOverall, this prompt definition file provides a clear and specific task for the model to generate a high-quality summary that is both informative and thought-provoking.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"MODES_OF_NATURE\"\nDescription List: [\"The three modes of nature (sattva, rajas, and tamas) and their influence on the living entity\", \"The three modes of nature (sattva, rajas, and tamas) that influence a living entity's behavior\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
