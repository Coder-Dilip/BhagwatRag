{"result": "A fascinating prompt!\n\nThe goal is to generate a profound, philosophical summary of a given entity (in this case, \"LIBERATION\") and its related descriptions, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*. Here's a breakdown of the requirements:\n\n1. **Theme alignment**: The summary should reflect philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships, aligning with the principles of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n2. **Coherent narrative**: Write the summary in third person, including the entity name (\"LIBERATION\") and maintaining a clear narrative flow.\n3. **Contextualization**: Emphasize relevant concepts from the *Bhagavad Gita*, such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, to provide a deeper spiritual significance.\n4. **Contradiction resolution**: Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, considering interpretations that align with the teachings of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n\nThe provided data includes the entity \"LIBERATION\" and a list of three descriptions related to its concept. The task is to synthesize these descriptions into a single summary that captures both their literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nExample summary (note: this is not the expected output, but rather an attempt to demonstrate the requirements):\n\n\"In the pursuit of LIBERATION, one seeks to attain freedom from material bondage, transcending the cycle of birth and death. This concept encompasses the attainment of freedom from the confines of the material world, as well as the liberation from the cycle of rebirth and death. Through the lens of the *Bhagavad Gita*, this pursuit can be seen as a manifestation of duty, virtue, and the quest for self-realization. Ultimately, LIBERATION represents the attainment of union with the divine, where the individual soul (Atman) merges with the ultimate reality (Brahman).\"", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nSUMMARIZE_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a knowledgeable assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided below, inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*.\nGiven one or two entities and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities, your goal is to synthesize these descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nIn your summary:\n- Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n- Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n- Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n- If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"LIBERATION\"\nDescription List: [\"Attaining freedom from material bondage\", \"The attainment of freedom from the cycle of birth and death\", \"The concept of liberation from the cycle of birth and death\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
