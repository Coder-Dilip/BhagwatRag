Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

He says the three gunas arise out of Nature. Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas are the three gunas and these bind the soul in the body.\n\nSattva is pure and shining because it is sinless. This soul is bonded to the body due to the desire for happiness and knowledge. Know that this is not the knowledge that leads to the Supreme but about other things. The knowledge of the Supreme frees the soul.\n\nRajas is based on the thirst for more and greed for whatever the body already possesses. Such a soul is bound to the body due to a desire for action with a focus on the fruits of the action. It binds the soul firmly to the body as it continues to perform actions for the fulfillment of materialistic desires.\n\nThe third type of guna is Tamas which arises out of ignorance and delusion. Such a soul does not know about God and is always wanting pleasure. This soul is bound to the body through wrong decisions, laziness, and sleep.\n\nAll three Gunas are present in all beings. However, one of them tends to be stronger and it becomes the nature of a person. Know that strong knowledge of God increases Sattva and leads to happiness. When Rajas becomes strong, the person experiences greed, restlessness, and a desire for more. When Tamas becomes strong, delusion and lack of action are dominant.\n\nA successful person is one who tries to\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
