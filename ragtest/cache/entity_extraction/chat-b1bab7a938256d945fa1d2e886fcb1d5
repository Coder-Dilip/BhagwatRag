{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) task, specifically for extracting entities and relationships from a text passage inspired by the Bhagavad Gita. The file provides a detailed description of the task, including the goal, steps, and examples.\n\nThe goal is to extract meaningful entities and relationships from the text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth of the Bhagavad Gita. The entities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the text, and the relationships should be based on philosophical or symbolic connections between the entities.\n\nThe steps involve:\n\n1. Identifying all entities in the text and extracting information about each entity, including its name, type, and description.\n2. Identifying pairs of related entities and extracting information about the relationship between them, including the source and target entities, relationship description, and relationship strength.\n3. Returning the output as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2, using **##** as the list delimiter.\n\nThe file also provides examples of output for two different text passages, as well as a real data section that includes a text passage and expected output.\n\nThe CONTINUE_PROMPT and LOOP_PROMPT variables are used to guide the user through the task, asking if they want to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text, and if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.
