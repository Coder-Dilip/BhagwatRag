Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Confusion leads to loss of intellect and brings destruction. Therefore, one must strive to control one’s desires and, thereby, one’s senses.\n\nThis is the summary of Bhagavad Gita, chapter two. The next chapter is about the teachings of Sri Krishna about Karma Yoga (action) that leads to God.\n\nAction without the desire for an outcome (the fruits of karma/action) does not accrue sins. No one can live without action. Renunciation of action is not possible. The very nature of people forces them to act. Merely becoming inactive is not renunciation and does not provide ‘liberation’ (moksha).\n\nWith action, there comes a state in the lives of people where they realize they are the atman (soul) and have nothing to lose or gain by inaction or action (karma/duties). Thus, they continue doing their duties or action to attain liberation (moksha).\n\nAn influential person must also perform his actions because others following his suit are inspired. A liberated person continues to perform action (karma) even though he desires nothing from the world.\n\nThe teachings of Sri Krishna in this chapter of the Bhagavad Gita turn towards Himself from verse twenty-two onward. Lord Krishna tells Arjuna that God is free from duties and doesn’t desire anything, but He is still engaged in action. If He ceases to act, the world will end.\n\nPeople look upon Him as\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
