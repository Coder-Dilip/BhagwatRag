Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

It just shows the anxiety of Dhritrashtra, Duryodhna, and Arjuna. The chapter begins with Dhritrashtra asking Sanjaya what happened in the Kurukshetra battlefield after both parties assembled for war. It is said he was expecting that the Pandavas would retreat from the war owing to the piousness of the Kurukshetra battlefield.\n\nThe eldest son of Dhritrashtra was anxious as well. He tried to comfort himself by talking to his guru Drona, and by comparing the armies on both sides. He spoke to Drona about the warriors on both sides, thereby consoling himself that the Kauravas had the capability to win the war easily.\n\nFinally, Arjuna asks Sri Krishna to drive his chariot to the middle of the battlefield. He becomes anxious and overwhelmed upon seeing his own brothers, uncles, and relatives on the other side. Despondent, he says he will not fight and puts down his bow.\n\nThe teachings of Lord Krishna begin in verse eleven of this chapter. Lord Krishna tells Arjuna that the wise should not grieve for people living or dead. He tells him that it is not the first time they (the armies) are going to die. They existed even before this birth and will continue to exist even after their death. The wise should know this truth\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
