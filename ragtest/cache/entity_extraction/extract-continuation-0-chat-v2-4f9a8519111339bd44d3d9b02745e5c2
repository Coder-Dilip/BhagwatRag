Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

And when one is in full consciousness of Me by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.\n Though engaged in all kinds of activities, My pure devotee, under My protection, reaches the eternal and imperishable abode by My grace.\n In all activities just depend upon Me and work always under My protection. In such devotional service, be fully conscious of Me.\n If you become conscious of Me, you will pass over all the obstacles of conditioned life by My grace. If, however, you do not work in such consciousness but act through false ego, not hearing Me, you will be lost.\n If you do not act according to My direction and do not fight, then you will be falsely directed. By your nature, you will have to be engaged in warfare.\n Under illusion you are now declining to act according to My direction. But, compelled by the work born of your own nature, you will act all the same, O son of Kuntī.\n The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.\n O scion of Bharata, surrender unto Him utterly. By His grace you will attain transcendental peace and the supreme and eternal abode.\n Thus I have explained to you knowledge still more confidential.
