Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence.\n There are three gates leading to this hell – lust, anger and greed. Every sane man should give these up, for they lead to the degradation of the soul.\n The man who has escaped these three gates of hell, O son of Kuntī, performs acts conducive to self-realization and thus gradually attains the supreme destination.\n He who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own whims attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme destination.\n One should therefore understand what is duty and what is not duty by the regulations of the scriptures. Knowing such rules and regulations, one should act so that he may gradually be elevated.\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?

The prompts are inspired by the Bhagavad Gita, a Hindu scripture, and are designed to encourage the extraction of philosophical concepts, symbolic relationships, and relational depth.\n\nThe script defines three main prompts:\n\n1. `GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT`: This prompt guides the extraction of entities and relationships from text. It provides steps for identifying entities, extracting entity information, and identifying relationships between entities.\n2. `CONTINUE_PROMPT`: This prompt encourages the user to add additional concepts, symbols, or entities that may further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n3. `LOOP_PROMPT`: This prompt asks the user if they have finished identifying entities and relationships, and if not, whether they would like to continue extracting additional information.\n\nThe script also includes two examples of texts and their corresponding outputs, which demonstrate how to apply the prompts.\n\nOverall, this script appears to be a tool for annotating text with entities and relationships, with a focus on philosophical and symbolic themes. It could be used in a variety of applications, such as natural language processing, text analysis, or data mining."}]}
