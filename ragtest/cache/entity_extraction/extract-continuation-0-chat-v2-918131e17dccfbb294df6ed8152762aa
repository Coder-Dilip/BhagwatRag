Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

The onus of this chapter is on the cultivation of knowledge that burns away all desires and sensory perceptions so that a person can see God in everything. In this summary of Bhagavad Gita, chapter five, He talks about Karma Yoga (Action) and the Path of Renunciation (of desires).Chapter five of Bhagavad Gita starts with a question from Arjuna, put to Lord Sri Krishna. He asks Lord Krishna to tell him which method is better: Renunciation or Karma Yoga (action). In reply, Lord Krishna says though both renunciation and action lead to liberation, action is better, provided it is performed without attachment to its fruits.\n\nOne need not completely renounce the world and action to become a sanyasi (one who has renounced the world, as per general belief). A person who has no desires and does not hate anything is also a sanyasi.\n\nThe same state can be achieved through unattached action. Both paths lead to liberation. One who has given up desires and is firmly established in God, knows that sins won’t accrue to him even if he performs his action (duties). He knows that the world is the result of sensory perceptions. The wise are established in God and look upon things as being the same as them. All and everything are God\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
