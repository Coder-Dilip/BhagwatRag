{"result": "This is a file containing prompts definition for a task that involves extracting meaningful entities and relationships from a given text, specifically from the Bhagavad Gita. The prompts are designed to help the AI system identify and label entities, extract relationships, and provide a detailed description of the entities and their relationships.\n\nThe main prompts include:\n\n1. **GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT**: This prompt defines the task of extracting entities and relationships from a given text, including the types of entities that should be extracted (e.g., concepts, deities, teachings), the types of relationships that should be identified (e.g., causal, representational, contrastive), and the format for outputting the extracted entities and relationships.\n\n2. **CONTINUE_PROMPT**: This prompt encourages the AI system to continue identifying and extracting entities and relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage.\n\n3. **LOOP_PROMPT**: This prompt asks the AI system whether there are any additional entities or relationships that might be identified and extracted from the passage to provide further clarification or insight. The system can respond with either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nThe output of the tasks is expected to be a list of extracted entities and relationships, with each entity formatted as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>) and each relationship formatted as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>). The output is expected to be in English, with **##** as the list delimiter, and terminated by a <|COMPLETE|> marker.\n\nThe EXAMPLE section provided illustrates how the output should be formatted.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

By submissively hearing from an expert spiritual master, the expert disciple develops pure knowledge,\nwhich repels the onslaught of material illusion arising from the three modes of material nature. Finally this\npure knowledge itself ceases, just as fire ceases when the stock of fuel has been consumed.\n14-16. My dear Uddhava, I have thus explained to you perfect knowledge. There are philosophers, however,\nwho challenge My conclusion. They state that the natural position of the living entity is to engage in fruitive\nactivities, and they see him as the enjoyer of the happiness and unhappiness that accrue from his own work.\nAccording to this materialistic philosophy, the world, time, the revealed scriptures and the self are all\nvariegated and eternal, existing as a perpetual flow of transformations. Knowledge, moreover, cannot be one\nor eternal, because it arises from the different and changing forms of objects; thus knowledge itself is always\nsubject to change. Even if you accept such a philosophy, My dear Uddhava, there will still be perpetual\nbirth, death, old age and disease, since all living entities must accept a material body subject to the influence\nof time.\n17. Although the performer of fruitive activities desires perpetual happiness, it is clearly observed that\nmaterialistic workers are often unhappy and only occasionally satisfied, thus\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
