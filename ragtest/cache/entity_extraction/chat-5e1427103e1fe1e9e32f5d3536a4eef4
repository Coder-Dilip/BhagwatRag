{"result": "This is a script that defines prompts for extracting entities and relationships from a text, specifically from the Bhagavad Gita. The prompts guide the user to identify entities and relationships that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth of the text.\n\nThe main prompt is `GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT` which outlines the steps for entity extraction and relationship identification. The steps include:\n\n1. Identifying entities and extracting their names, types, and descriptions.\n2. Identifying pairs of related entities and extracting their relationships, including descriptions and relationship strengths.\n3. Returning the output as a list of entities and relationships, separated by `##`.\n\nThe prompt also includes examples of output format and examples of entity types.\n\nAdditionally, there are two other prompts defined: `CONTINUE_PROMPT` and `LOOP_PROMPT`.\n\n`CONTINUE_PROMPT` is a hint to encourage the user to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that might further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n\n`LOOP_PROMPT` is a question that asks the user if there are any additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage. The user can respond with either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nOverall, this script aims to facilitate a deeper understanding and analysis of the Bhagavad Gita by identifying and extracting relevant entities and relationships.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

In this way the self-realized person enjoys unlimited happiness, for he concentrates on the Supreme.\n An intelligent person does not take part in the sources of misery, which are due to contact with the material senses. O son of Kuntī, such pleasures have a beginning and an end, and so the wise man does not delight in them.\n Before giving up this present body, if one is able to tolerate the urges of the material senses and check the force of desire and anger, he is well situated and is happy in this world.\n One whose happiness is within, who is active and rejoices within, and whose aim is inward is actually the perfect mystic. He is liberated in the Supreme, and ultimately he attains the Supreme.\n Those who are beyond the dualities that arise from doubts, whose minds are engaged within, who are always busy working for the welfare of all living beings and who are free from all sins achieve liberation in the Supreme.\n Those who are free from anger and all material desires, who are self-realized, self-disciplined and constantly endeavoring for perfection, are assured\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
