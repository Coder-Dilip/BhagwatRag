{"result": "This is a script for a natural language processing (NLP) task, specifically a prompt for extracting entities and relationships from a text based on the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture. The script defines several prompts and output formats for extracting entities and relationships from a given text.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the script:\n\n1. **GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT**: This is the main prompt for extracting entities and relationships from the text. It provides guidelines for identifying and labeling entities (concepts, deities, emotions, etc.) and relationships between them.\n2. **Examples**: The script provides two example outputs to illustrate how entities and relationships can be extracted from a text.\n3. **Real Data**: This section provides a sample text passage from the Bhagavad Gita, along with expected output for entity and relationship extraction.\n4. **CONTINUE_PROMPT**: This prompt asks the user if there are any additional concepts, symbols, or entities that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage.\n5. **LOOP_PROMPT**: This prompt is repeated until the user answers \"NO\", encouraging them to continue extracting entities and relationships until they are satisfied.\n\nThe script uses a specific format for outputting entities and relationships, including:\n\n* \"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>: This format is used to output each identified entity, including its name, type, and description.\n* \"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>: This format is used to output each identified relationship, including the source and target entities, description, and strength.\n\nOverall, this script provides a structured framework for NLP tasks that involve entity and relationship extraction from text, specifically in the context of the Bhagavad Gita.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. He explains the nature of duty, selflessness, and the eternal soul.\n######################\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>KRISHNA<|>DEITY<|>Krishna is the supreme deity who provides wisdom and guidance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARJUNA<|>PERSON<|>A warrior seeking guidance on duty and life)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUTY<|>CONCEPT<|>The principle of fulfilling one's responsibilities without attachment to outcomes)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KRISHNA<|>ARJUNA<|>Krishna guides Arjuna in understanding his duty<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KRISHNA<|>DUTY<|>Krishna imparts the concept of duty as essential for spiritual growth<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\nExample 2:\nText:\nArjuna experiences intense inner conflict, torn between his warrior duty and his compassion for family members on the opposing side.\n######################\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>ARJUNA<|>PERSON<|>Arjuna is a warrior experiencing moral and emotional conflict)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUTY<|>CONCEPT<|>The concept of duty as Arjuna’s responsibility as a warrior)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPASSION<|>VIRTUE<|>A virtue that causes Arjuna emotional turmoil on the battlefield)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUTY<|>COMPASSION<|>Duty and compassion create an inner conflict within Arjuna<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Real Data-\n######################\nEntity_types: DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING\nText: parā (disciplic succession). We have to receive knowledge from the proper source in disciplic succession beginning with the supreme spiritual master, the Lord Himself, and handed down to a succession of spiritual masters. Arjuna, the student who took lessons from Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, accepts everything that He says without contradicting Him. One is not allowed to accept one portion of Bhagavad-gītā and not another. No. We must accept Bhagavad-gītā without interpretation, without deletion and without our own whimsical participation in the matter. The Gītā should be taken as the most perfect presentation of Vedic knowledge. Vedic knowledge is received from transcendental sources, and the first words were spoken by the Lord Himself. The words spoken by the Lord are called apauruṣeya, meaning that they are different from words spoken by a person of the mundane world who is infected with four defects. A mundaner (1) is sure to commit mistakes, (2) is invariably illusioned, (3) has the tendency to cheat others and (4) is limited by imperfect senses. With these four imperfections, one cannot deliver perfect information of all-pervading knowledge.\n\nVedic knowledge is not imparted by such defective living entities. It was imparted unto the heart of Brahmā, the first created living being, and Brahmā in his turn\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
