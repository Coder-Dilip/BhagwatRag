{"result": "This file contains the definition of prompts related to extracting entities and relationships from the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture.\n\nThe **GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT** is a comprehensive instruction for extracting entities and relationships from the text. It consists of four main steps:\n\n1. Identify entities, which are concepts, characters, virtues, emotions, mindsets, actions, etc., and extract their name, type, and description.\n2. Identify pairs of related entities and extract information such as the source entity, target entity, relationship description, and relationship strength.\n3. Return the extracted entities and relationships as a list, separated by **##**, and marked with **<|COMPLETE|>** when finished.\n4. Provide additional prompts to encourage further exploration and extraction of entities and relationships.\n\n**CONTINUE_PROMPT** is a supplementary prompt that encourages the participant to continue identifying and extracting entities and relationships.\n\n**LOOP_PROMPT** is a repetitive prompt that asks the participant to answer whether there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage. If the answer is YES, the process continues; if the answer is NO, the participant moves on.\n\nThese prompts are designed to help users extract meaningful entities and relationships from the Bhagavad Gita, uncovering its deeper philosophical and symbolic themes and relationships.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

They seek refuge within Him and know that He is the indestructible origin of all beings. Such souls show utmost respect to God and sing praises of Him, focusing on Him only.\n\nPeople who worship other gods, in fact, worship the Almighty only because He is the receiver of sacrifices, and He is the provider of fruits thereof. Such people attain God in the form they choose. Others who desire heaven, go to heaven, and stay there until their virtuous deeds are exhausted; then they return to earth (rebirth).\n\nHe who worships God with anything, however great or small an offering it be, God accepts it gladly. Lord Krishna teaches Arjuna that whatever he does, he should offer the fruits to God so that he doesn’t accrue any sin. With the Self absorbed in God, the atman (soul) will attain God and would be liberated from rebirths.\n\nThis is the summary of Bhagavad Gita, chapter nine. The main takeaway is that everyone worships the same God and whoever is devoted to God, attains God instead of having to be reborn.\nThe teachings from this chapter of Bhagavad Gita go on to show how great God is. It highlights Him in the different objects – living and non-living. For example, Lord Krishna says to Arjuna that He is the Sun among all\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
