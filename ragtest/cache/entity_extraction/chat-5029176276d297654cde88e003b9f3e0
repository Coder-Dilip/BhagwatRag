{"result": "It appears that this file contains a set of predefined prompts for extracting entities and relationships from a text passage inspired by the Bhagavad Gita. The prompts are used to guide a language model or AI system in identifying and labeling entities, relationships, and concepts within the text.\n\nThe main prompts are:\n\n* GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT: This is the primary prompt that provides instructions for extracting entities and relationships from the text. It starts by stating the goal of the task, defines the types of entities to be extracted, and outlines the steps to be taken. The prompt provides examples of how to format the extracted entities and relationships.\n* CONTINUE_PROMPT: This prompt is used to encourage the language model to continue adding new concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n* LOOP_PROMPT: This prompt is used to determine whether further entities or relationships need to be extracted from the text. The model is asked to answer YES or NO to indicate whether there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage.\n\nThe file also provides examples of the output format for both entities and relationships, as well as a sample text passage and its corresponding output. The example text passage is from the Bhagavad Gita, and the output includes entities and relationships that capture the philosophical and symbolic themes present in the text.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

A man who has many wives is constantly harassed by them. He is responsible for their maintenance, and\nthus all the ladies constantly pull him in different directions, each struggling for her self-interest. Similarly,\nthe material senses harass the conditioned soul, pulling him in many different directions at once. On one\nside the tongue is pulling him to arrange tasty food; then thirst drags him to get a suitable drink.\nSimultaneously the sex organs clamor for satisfaction, and the sense of touch demands soft, sensuous\nobjects. The belly harasses him until it is filled, the ears demand to hear pleasing sounds, the sense of smell\nhankers for pleasant aromas, and the fickle eyes clamor for pleasing sights. Thus the senses, organs and\nlimbs, all desiring satisfaction, pull the living entity in many directions.\n28. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, expanding His own potency, maya-sakti, created innumerable\nspecies of life to house the conditioned souls. Yet by creating the forms of trees, reptiles, animals, birds,\nsnakes and so on, the Lord was not satisfied within His heart. Then He created human life, which offers the\nconditioned soul sufficient intelligence to perceive the Absolute Truth, and became pleased.\n29.
