{"result": "This is a file containing prompts definitions for a task related to extracting entities and relationships from a given text. The task is to analyze the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture, and extract meaningful entities, their types, and relationships between them.\n\nThe prompts are organized into several sections:\n\n1. **GRAPH EXTRACTION PROMPT**: This section provides detailed instructions on what to do. It is divided into four steps:\n\t* Step 1: Identify all entities, extract their name, type, and a detailed description.\n\t* Step 2: Identify pairs of related entities and extract information about the relationship between them, including a description and a strength score.\n\t* Step 3: Return the output as a single list of all entities and relationships.\n\t* Step 4: Output a completion indicator.\n\n2. **EXAMPLES**: This section includes two examples of how the task should be performed, using a given text and expected output.\n\n3. **REAL DATA**: This section provides the actual data to be used for the task. It includes entity types and a text passage.\n\n4. **CONTINUE PROMPT**, **LOOP PROMPT**: These are additional prompts that can be used to iterate the process until all relevant information has been extracted.\n\nOverall, this file provides a comprehensive guide for a specific task related to extracting entities and relationships from a given text, and it provides examples and real-world data to help users understand and perform the task.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

The male pigeon said: Alas, just see how I am now destroyed! I am obviously a great fool, for I did not\nproperly execute pious activities. I could not satisfy myself, nor could I fulfill the purpose of life. My dear\nfamily, which was the basis of my religiosity, economic development and sense gratification, is now\nhopelessly ruined.\n69. My wife and I were an ideal match. She always faithfully obeyed me and in fact accepted me as her\nworshipable deity. But now, seeing her children lost and her home empty, she has left me behind and gone\nto heaven with our saintly children.\n70. Now I am a wretched person living in an empty home. My wife is dead; my children are dead. Why\nshould I possibly want to live? My heart is so pained by separation from my family that life itself has\nbecome simply suffering.\n71. As the father pigeon wretchedly stared at his poor children trapped in the net and on the verge of death,\npathetically struggling to free themselves, his mind went blank, and thus he himself fell into the hunter’s net.\n72. The cruel hunter, having fulfilled his desire by capturing the head pigeon, his wife and all of their\nchildren, set off for his own home.\n73.
