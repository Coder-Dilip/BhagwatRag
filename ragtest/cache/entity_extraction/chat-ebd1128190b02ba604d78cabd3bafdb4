{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a task focused on extracting entities and relationships from a given text, specifically from the Bhagavad Gita. The task involves identifying and labeling entities such as concepts, virtues, emotions, and relationships between them, as well as capturing the philosophical and symbolic meanings within the text.\n\nThe file provides guidance on how to approach the task, including the following steps:\n\n1. Identify all entities and extract information about each entity, including its name, type, and description.\n2. Identify all pairs of related entities and extract information about each relationship, including the relationship description and strength.\n3. Return the output as a single list of all identified entities and relationships.\n\nThe file also includes examples to illustrate the expected output format and provides a real data example for testing purposes. There are three prompts defined:\n\n1. `GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT`: This is the main prompt that outlines the task and provides guidelines for entity identification and relationship extraction.\n2. `CONTINUE_PROMPT`: This prompt is used to encourage the user to add additional concepts, symbols, or entities that might further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n3. `LOOP_PROMPT`: This prompt is used to ask the user if there are any additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage.\n\nOverall, this prompt definition file is designed to guide a user in extracting meaningful entities and relationships from a passage of the Bhagavad Gita and to encourage them to think deeply about the philosophical and symbolic themes within the text.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

Lord Krishna tells Arjuna that He is the knower (kshetrajana) of the field (kshetra) and that the knowledge of this field and knower of that field is the true and only knowledge one should pursue.\n\nComponents of this field are earth, air, fire, water, sky, the ego, the intellect, the ten organs of sense, the five senses, and the mind. Other components are desire, happiness, hatred, unhappiness, conscience, and patience.\n\nKnowledge is composed of: Lack of ego, lack of arrogance, lack of injury to others, forgiveness, humility, purity, single-mindedness, control of self, detachment towards objects good and bad, faithfulness, devotion, and search for true knowledge.\n\nLord Krishna says that one who has knowledge of the field and knower of that field (God is the knower), attains God. He says the world is the result of Prakriti (the substance with which the world is formed) and Purusha (the eternal soul that has no beginning and end). One who sees the world as a game of Purusha and Prakriti knows no rebirth and is established in God.\n\nHe who sees God in everything knows not to hurt others because he knows that hurting others is akin to hurting himself and the Supreme Soul.
