Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The prompts guide the extraction of meaningful entities and relationships that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth of the text.\n\nThe prompts are structured into four steps:\n\n1. Identify entities: Identify all entities in the text and extract the entity name, type, and description. The entity types can include DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, etc.\n2. Identify relationships: Identify pairs of entities that are clearly related to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way. Extract the source entity, target entity, relationship description, and relationship strength.\n3. Return output: Return the output in a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n4. Final step: When finished, output \"<|COMPLETE|>\".\n\nThe prompts provide examples of the expected output and a sample text for real data. The real data includes entities such as DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, and EMOTION, along with their descriptions and relationships.\n\nThe CONTINUE_PROMPT and LOOP_PROMPT provide additional guidance on what to do next if there are remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that need to be explored. The LOOP_PROMPT asks if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage. The user can answer YES or NO to determine if they need to continue extracting or if they can move on to the next passage."}]}
