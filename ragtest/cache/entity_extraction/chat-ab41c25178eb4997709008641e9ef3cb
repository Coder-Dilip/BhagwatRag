{"result": "This is a file containing prompts definition for a task that involves extracting entities and relationships from a text inspired by the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture. The prompts are designed to guide the user in identifying and labeling entities, and then identifying relationships between these entities.\n\nThe main prompt is divided into four steps:\n\n1. Identify all entities in the text and extract information about each entity, including its name, type, and description.\n2. Identify pairs of related entities and extract information about each pair, including the source and target entities, the relationship description, and the relationship strength.\n3. Return the output as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2, using **##** as the list delimiter.\n4. When finished, output `<|COMPLETE|>`.\n\nThe prompts also include examples of output for each step, as well as a real data section that provides a sample text and expected output.\n\nThe CONTINUE_PROMPT is used to encourage the user to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n\nThe LOOP_PROMPT is used to ask the user if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage. The user can answer YES or NO to indicate whether they want to continue exploring the text.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

When one passes in light, he does not come back; but when one passes in darkness, he returns.\n Although the devotees know these two paths, O Arjuna, they are never bewildered. Therefore be always fixed in devotion.\n A person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the results derived from studying the Vedas, performing sacrifices, undergoing austerities, giving charity or pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities. Simply by performing devotional service, he attains all these, and at the end he reaches the supreme eternal abode.\nChapter Nine\nThe Most Confidential Knowledge\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, because you are never envious of Me, I shall impart to you this most confidential knowledge and realization, knowing which you shall be relieved of the miseries of material existence.\nThis knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed.\nThose who are not faithful in this devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of enemies.
