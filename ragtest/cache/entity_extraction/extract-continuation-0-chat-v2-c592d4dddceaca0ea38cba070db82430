Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Such a\nperson, although situated within the body, is not entangled.\n15. Sometimes for no apparent reason one’s body is attacked by cruel people or violent animals. At other\ntimes and in other places, one will suddenly be offered great respect or worship. One who becomes neither\nangry when attacked nor satisfied when worshiped is actually intelligent.\n16. A saintly sage sees with equal vision and therefore is not affected by that which is materially good or\nbad. Indeed, although he observes others performing good and bad work and speaking properly and\nimproperly, the sage does not praise or criticize anyone.\n17. For the purpose of maintaining his body, a liberated sage should not act, speak or contemplate in terms\nof material good or bad. Rather, he should be detached in all material circumstances, and taking pleasure in\nself-realization, he should wander about engaged in this liberated life-style, appearing like a retarded person\nto outsiders.\n18. If through meticulous study one becomes expert in reading Vedic literature but makes no endeavor to fix\none’s mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then one’s endeavor is certainly like that of a man who\nworks very hard to take care of a cow that gives no milk. In other words, the fruit of one’s laborious study of\nVedic knowledge will simply be the labor itself. There will be no other tangible result\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
