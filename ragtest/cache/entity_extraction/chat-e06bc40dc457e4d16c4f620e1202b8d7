{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a task that involves extracting entities and relationships from a given text, specifically from the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture. The task is divided into three main steps:\n\n1. Extracting entities:\n\t* Identify all entities in the text, such as concepts, deities, emotions, mindsets, and teachings.\n\t* For each entity, extract the following information: entity name, entity type, and a detailed description of the entity's attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications.\n\t* Format each entity as a JSON object with the following structure: (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n2. Identifying relationships:\n\t* Identify all pairs of related entities that are clearly related to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\n\t* For each pair of related entities, extract the following information: source entity, target entity, relationship description, and relationship strength (a numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship).\n\t* Format each relationship as a JSON object with the following structure: (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n3. Outputting the results:\n\t* Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.\n\t* Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\nThe file also includes examples and real data sections to help illustrate the task and provide context.\n\nThe CONTINUE_PROMPT and LOOP_PROMPT sections are used to encourage the AI model to continue exploring the text and identifying additional entities and relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

And how can there be any happiness without peace?\n As a strong wind sweeps away a boat on the water, even one of the roaming senses on which the mind focuses can carry away a man’s intelligence.\n Therefore, O mighty-armed, one whose senses are restrained from their objects is certainly of steady intelligence.\n What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage.\n A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires – that enter like rivers into the ocean, which is ever being filled but is always still – can alone achieve peace, and not the man who strives to satisfy such desires.\n A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of false ego – he alone can attain real peace.\n That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is not bewildered. If one is thus situated even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God.\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
