Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

His behavior is always\npleasing, never harsh and always exemplary, and he is free from possessiveness. He never endeavors in\nordinary, worldly activities, and he strictly controls his eating. He therefore always remains peaceful and\nsteady. A saintly person is thoughtful and accepts Me as his only shelter. Such a person is very cautious in\nthe execution of his duties and is never subject to superficial transformations, because he is steady and\nnoble, even in a distressing situation. He has conquered over the six material qualities—namely hunger,\nthirst, lamentation, illusion, old age and death. He is free from all desire for prestige and offers honor to\nothers. He is expert in reviving the Krsna consciousness of others and therefore never cheats anyone. Rather,\nhe is a well-wishing friend to all, being most merciful. Such a saintly person must be considered the most\nlearned of men. He perfectly understands that the ordinary religious duties prescribed by Me in various\nVedic scriptures possess favorable qualities that purify the performer, and he knows that neglect of such\nduties constitutes a discrepancy in one’s life. Having taken complete shelter at My lotus feet, however, a\nsaintly person ultimately renounces such ordinary religious duties and worships Me alone. He is thus\nconsidered to be the best among all living entities.\n33.

The prompts are designed to capture the philosophical and symbolic essence of the text.\n\nThe main prompts are:\n\n1. GRAPH EXTRACTION PROMPT: This prompt asks the user to extract entities and relationships from the text. Entities are defined as meaningful concepts, deities, individuals, and concepts that capture the philosophical essence of the text. Relationships are categorized into different types (e.g., causal, representational, contrastive) and are scored for their philosophical significance.\n\nThe prompt provides an example of the expected output format, which includes entity names, types, and descriptions, as well as relationship descriptions and strength scores.\n\n2. CONTINUE PROMPT: This prompt is designed to encourage the user to add additional entities or relationships to the output.\n\n3. LOOP PROMPT: This prompt is used to determine whether the user has finished extracting entities and relationships. The user is asked to answer YES or NO to indicate whether additional entities or relationships need to be extracted.\n\nThe file also includes some real data and an example of the output for a given text passage. The real data includes the text passage itself, as well as the expected output, which is used to demonstrate the format and content of the output.\n\nThe prompts are designed to be flexible and adaptable to different text passages and entities, and can be used as a starting point for developing a natural language processing (NLP) model or a machine learning algorithm to extract entities and relationships from text."}]}
