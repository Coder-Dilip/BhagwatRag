{"result": "This is a file containing prompts definition for a task related to extracting entities and relationships from a text inspired by the Bhagavad Gita. The prompts are designed to guide the user in identifying and labeling entities, such as concepts, deities, virtues, emotions, and mindsets, and their relationships with each other.\n\nThe prompts are structured into four main steps:\n\n1. Identify entities: The user is asked to identify all entities in the text and extract information about each entity, including its name, type, and description.\n2. Identify relationships: The user is asked to identify pairs of related entities and extract information about the relationship between them, including the description of the relationship and its strength.\n3. Return output: The user is asked to return the output in a specific format, using **##** as the list delimiter, and including the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.\n4. Continue or loop: The user is asked to continue or loop back to the beginning of the task to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n\nThe prompts also include examples and real data to help illustrate the expected output and provide a starting point for the user.\n\nSome key concepts and entities mentioned in the prompts include:\n\n* DEITY: A type of entity that represents a divine being or a higher power.\n* PERSON: A type of entity that represents an individual human being.\n* CONCEPT: A type of entity that represents an abstract idea or principle.\n* VIRTUE: A type of entity that represents a moral or ethical quality.\n* EMOTION: A type of entity that represents a feeling or sentiment.\n* MINDSET: A type of entity that represents a mental attitude or perspective.\n* ACTION: A type of entity that represents a physical or mental activity.\n* TEACHING: A type of entity that represents a lesson or instruction.\n\nThe prompts also mention the importance of considering the philosophical and symbolic relationships between entities, and the need to provide detailed descriptions of each entity and its relationships.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

When,\nhowever, one is fully engaged in searching out the ultimate truth of the soul, one should not accept the\nscriptural injunctions governing fruitive activities.\n5. One who has accepted Me as the supreme goal of life should strictly observe the scriptural injunctions\nforbidding sinful activities and, as far as possible, should execute the injunctions prescribing minor\nregulative duties such as cleanliness. Ultimately, however, one should approach a bona fide spiritual master\nwho is full in knowledge of Me as I am, who is peaceful, and who by spiritual elevation is not different from\nMe.\n6. The servant or disciple of the spiritual master should be free from false prestige, never considering\nhimself to be the doer. He should be active and never lazy and should give up all sense of proprietorship\nover the objects of the senses, including his wife, children, home and society. He should be endowed with\nfeelings of loving friendship toward the spiritual master and should never become deviated or bewildered.\nThe servant or disciple should always desire advancement in spiritual understanding, should not envy\nanyone and should always avoid useless conversation.\n7. One should see one’s real self-interest in life in all circumstances and should therefore remain detached\nfrom wife, children, home, land, relatives, friends, wealth and so on.\n8.
