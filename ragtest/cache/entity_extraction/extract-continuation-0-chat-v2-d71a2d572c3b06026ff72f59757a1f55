Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

That kind of action will liberate him, and he will not accrue any sins of which he is afraid. People who think they are responsible for their actions are deluded and end up miserable.\n\nThis is the summary of Bhagavad Gita, chapter three. Chapter four explains other types of yoga that can lead to God and liberation.\nThis chapter summary of Bhagavad Gita focuses on the soul. Sri Krishna says both He and Arjuna had many births earlier. He says He is eternal; He has no birth; He is indestructible; and He is the Lord of all beings. Existing in His own nature, He manifests Himself through Maya (illusion: sensory perceptions).\n\nHe says to Arjuna that whenever dharma (righteousness) goes into decline and adharma (unrighteousness) increases, He manifests Himself to protect the pious, destroy the evil, and uphold the dharma. People who know Him to be eternal and his nature (Maya), are liberated from the cycle of rebirths, and when they die, they attain Him.\n\nLord Krishna explains action (karma) to Arjuna by saying people who know action in inaction and inaction in action have the right to action and are wise. Whoever acts without desire or ownership is wise.\n\nHe explains sacrifices, or yajnas, as they are called.

Answer YES | NO.\\n\"\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This appears to be a prompt definition for a natural language processing (NLP) task or a machine learning model training data. The prompt is focused on extracting entities and relationships from a passage of text related to the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture.\n\nThe prompt provides a clear structure for the task, including:\n\n1. Goal: To extract entities and relationships from the text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth of the Bhagavad Gita.\n2. Steps: The prompt outlines three steps for extracting entities and relationships:\n\t* Identify all entities and extract information such as entity name, type, and description.\n\t* Identify pairs of related entities and extract information such as source entity, target entity, relationship description, and relationship strength.\n\t* Return output in a specific format as a single list of all the identified entities and relationships.\n3. Examples: The prompt provides two examples of output for different passages of text.\n4. Real Data: The prompt provides a real passage of text related to the Bhagavad Gita and expects the model to extract entities and relationships from this passage.\n\nThe prompt also includes specific keywords and phrases that can help guide the model's understanding of the text, such as \"duty\", \"virtue\", \"emotion\", \"mindset\", \"action\", and \"teaching\". Additionally, the prompt provides specific entity types, such as \"DEITY\", \"PERSON\", \"CONCEPT\", \"VIRTUE\", and \"EMOTION\", that the model should use when labeling entities.\n\nOverall, this prompt appears to be designed to test the model's ability to extract meaningful entities and relationships from a passage of text related to the Bhagavad Gita, and to understand the philosophical and symbolic themes present in the text."}]}
