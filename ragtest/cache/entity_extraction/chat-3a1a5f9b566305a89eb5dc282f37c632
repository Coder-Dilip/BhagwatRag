{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) task. The file defines several prompts, variables, and examples for extracting entities and relationships from a given text. \n\nThe main prompt is for extracting entities and relationships from a text passage that is inspired by the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture. The task involves identifying entities of different types (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING) and relationships between these entities. \n\nThe entities are required to reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the Bhagavad Gita. The entities should be labeled with their type and a description of their attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. \n\nThe relationships between entities should also be identified, along with a description of how the source and target entities are related in a philosophical or symbolic way. The relationships should be scored for their philosophical significance, with a higher score indicating a more foundational relationship.\n\nThe prompt also includes an example and a section for real data, which provides a text passage for testing the NLP model. \n\nThe CONTINUE_PROMPT and LOOP_PROMPT are used as guiding text to help the user continue extracting entities and relationships or answer whether there are additional entities or relationships to be extracted.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Kindly tell me, sir,\nhow did you acquire this extraordinary intelligence, and why are you traveling freely throughout the world\nbehaving as if you were a child?\n27. Generally human beings work hard to cultivate religiosity, economic development, sense gratification\nand also knowledge of the soul, and their usual motive is to increase the duration of their lives, acquire fame\nand enjoy material opulence.\n28. You, however, although capable, learned, expert, handsome and most eloquent, are not engaged in doing\nanything, nor do you desire anything; rather, you appear stupefied and maddened as if you were a ghostly\ncreature.\n29. Although all people within the material world are burning in the great forest fire of lust and greed, you\nremain free and are not burned by that fire. You are just like an elephant who takes shelter from a forest fire\nby standing within the water of the Ganges River,\n30. O brahmana, we see that you are devoid of any contact with material enjoyment and that you are\ntraveling alone, without any companions or family members. Therefore, because we are sincerely inquiring\nfrom you, please tell us the cause of the great ecstasy that you are feeling within yourself.\n31.
