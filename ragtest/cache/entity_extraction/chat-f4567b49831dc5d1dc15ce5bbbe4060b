{"result": "This appears to be a set of prompts for a natural language processing (NLP) task, specifically for extracting entities and relationships from text related to the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture. The prompts provide detailed instructions for the task, including:\n\n1. Extracting entities: identify entities in the text and label them with appropriate types (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING) and descriptions.\n2. Identifying relationships: identify pairs of related entities and describe the relationships between them, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings.\n3. Returning output: provide the extracted entities and relationships in a list, separated by **##**, and include a **|COMPLETE|** indicator when finished.\n\nThe prompts also include examples of expected output and provide guidance on the types of entities and relationships that are relevant to the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe CONTINUE_PROMPT and LOOP_PROMPT appear to be used to encourage the NLP system to continue processing the text until it has extracted all relevant entities and relationships.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

Therefore, because we are sincerely inquiring\nfrom you, please tell us the cause of the great ecstasy that you are feeling within yourself.\n31. Lord Krsna continued: The intelligent King Yadu, always respectful to the brahmanas, waited with\nbowed head as the brahmana, pleased with the King’s attitude, began to reply.\n32. The brahmana said: My dear King, with my intelligence I have taken shelter of many spiritual masters.\nHaving gained transcendental understanding from them, I now wander about the earth in a liberated\ncondition. Please listen as I describe them to you.\n33-35. O King, I have taken shelter of twenty-four gurus, who are the following: the earth, air, sky, water,\nfire, moon, sun, pigeon and python; the sea, moth, honeybee, elephant and honey thief; the deer, the fish, the\nprostitute Pingala, the kurara bird and the child; and the young girl, arrow maker, serpent, spider and wasp.\nMy dear King, by studying their activities I have learned the science of the self.\n36.
