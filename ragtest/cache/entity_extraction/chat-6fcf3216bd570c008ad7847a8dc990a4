{"result": "This is a file containing prompts for a task that involves extracting entities and relationships from a given text passage, specifically from the Bhagavad Gita. The prompts guide the user to identify entities, extract their information, and create relationships between them.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the prompts:\n\n1. **GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT**: This is the main prompt that explains the task. It describes the goal, steps, and expected output. The user is asked to extract entities and relationships from the given text passage, using specific entity types (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, etc.) and relationship descriptions.\n2. **CONTINUE_PROMPT**: This prompt encourages the user to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that can further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n3. **LOOP_PROMPT**: This prompt asks the user if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage. The user can respond with \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nThe example outputs provided illustrate how the entities and relationships should be formatted, including the use of `<|>` delimiters to separate the entity and relationship information.\n\nBy following these prompts, the user is expected to generate a list of entities and relationships that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth of the Bhagavad Gita passage.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.
