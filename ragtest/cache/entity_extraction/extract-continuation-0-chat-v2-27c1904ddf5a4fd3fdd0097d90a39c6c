Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

Some verses are Arjuna praising Lord Krishna. The Lord concludes this chapter by saying everything movable and immovable comes into existence only because of His Grace.\n\nThe summary of Bhagavad Gita, chapter ten, is that God is the best and everything in this world is because of Him. Lord Krishna shows His universal form (Vishwa-Roopa) to Arjuna in the next chapter. Arjuna asks Lord Krishna to show him His universal form, so God provides him with divine vision and shows him His universal form, which is also known as Vishwa-Roopam. Since Sanjaya too had a divine vision, granted by sage Ved Vyasa, so that he could narrate proceedings of the battlefield to Dhritrashtra, he was also able to see the Vishwa-Roopa. He describes it to king Dhritrashtra.\n\nThe brilliance of the Lord was too much to behold. It could be said that if thousands of suns shone simultaneously on the battlefield, they could barely match the brilliance of God’s Vishwa-Roopa. There were many faces of the God, looking everywhere with many eyes and mouths; many ornaments and many weapons all around; divine garlands and divine fragrances.\n\nArjuna saw the universe divided into many parts in the body of God. Arjuna says to Lord Krishna that he could see\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?

The file defines prompts for extracting entities and relationships from text passages, with a focus on philosophical and symbolic themes.\n\nThe file contains several sections:\n\n1. **GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT**: This section provides a detailed prompt for extracting entities and relationships from text passages. The prompt consists of four steps:\n    - Identify entities and extract their names, types, and descriptions.\n    - Identify relationships between entities and extract information about the relationships.\n    - Return the output as a list of entities and relationships.\n    - Output a completion marker, `##COMPLETE##`.\n2. **Examples**: This section provides two examples of how the prompt should be applied. Each example includes a text passage and the expected output.\n3. **Real Data**: This section provides a text passage from the Bhagavad Gita, chapter 10, along with expected output for the entity and relationship extraction task.\n4. **Continue Prompt**: This section provides a prompt for continuing the entity and relationship extraction task, asking the user to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n5. **Loop Prompt**: This section provides a prompt for continuing the task, asking the user if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage.
