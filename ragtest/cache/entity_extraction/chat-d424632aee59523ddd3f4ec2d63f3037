{"result": "This is a programming prompt definition file for a task that involves extracting entities and relationships from a given text, specifically from the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture. The prompt provides detailed instructions on how to extract entities, including their names, types, and descriptions, and relationships between them, along with a scoring system to measure the philosophical significance of these relationships.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the prompt:\n\n1. The task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships from the text, focusing on the philosophical essence, symbolic meanings, and relational depth of the Bhagavad Gita.\n2. The entities are categorized into types such as:\n\t* DEITY\n\t* PERSON\n\t* CONCEPT\n\t* VIRTUE\n\t* EMOTION\n\t* MINDSET\n\t* ACTION\n\t* TEACHING\n3. For each entity, it is required to extract the following information:\n\t* entity_name (the name of the entity, capitalized)\n\t* entity_type (the type of entity)\n\t* entity_description (a detailed description of the entity's attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications)\n4. After identifying all entities, the prompt asks to identify pairs of related entities that are \"clearly related\" to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way. For each pair, it is necessary to extract the following information:\n\t* source_entity (the name of the source entity)\n\t* target_entity (the name of the target entity)\n\t* relationship_description (an explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related)\n\t* relationship_strength (a numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities)\n5. The output should be a single list of all the entities and relationships identified, formatted as described in the prompt.\n6. The prompt provides two examples to demonstrate the expected output format.\n\nThe CONTINUE_PROMPT and LOOP_PROMPT sections are intended to facilitate the extraction process by asking the user to add additional concepts, symbols, or entities that might further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.
