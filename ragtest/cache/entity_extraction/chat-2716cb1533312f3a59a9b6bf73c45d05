{"result": "This appears to be a script or prompt definition for natural language processing (NLP) or artificial intelligence (AI) task, specifically for extracting entities and relationships from text inspired by the Bhagavad Gita. The script provides guidelines and examples for extraction and labeling entities and relationships.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the script:\n\n1. **GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT**: This is the main prompt, which defines the task of extracting entities and relationships from a given text inspired by the Bhagavad Gita.\n2. **Examples**: The script provides two examples of the output format, including entities and relationships.\n3. **CONTINUE_PROMPT**: This is a follow-up prompt asking the user to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n4. **LOOP_PROMPT**: This is a question prompt that asks the user if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage. The user is expected to answer YES or NO.\n\nThe script appears to be designed for a specific task and may require a domain-specific knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita to perform effectively. The entities and relationships identified through this script would likely be used to create a knowledge graph or a semantic network that captures the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Lord Brahma said: My dear Lord, previously we requested You to remove the burden of the earth. O\nunlimited Personality of Godhead, that request has certainly been fulfilled.\n22. My Lord, You have reestablished the principles of religion among pious men who are always firmly\nbound to the truth. You have also distributed Your glories all over the world, and thus the whole world can\nbe purified by hearing about You.\n23. Descending into the dynasty of King Yadu, You have manifested Your unique transcendental form, and\nfor the benefit of the entire universe You have executed magnanimous transcendental activities.\n24. My dear Lord, those pious and saintly persons who in the age of Kali hear about Your transcendental\nactivities and also glorify them will easily cross over the darkness of the age.\n25. O Supreme Personality of Godhead, O my Lord, You have descended into the Yadu dynasty, and thus\nYou have spent one hundred twenty-five autumns with Your devotees.\n26-27.
