Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

A saintly person, just like fire, sometimes appears in a concealed form and at other times reveals\nhimself. For the welfare of the conditioned souls who desire real happiness, a saintly person may accept the\nworshipable position of spiritual master, and thus like fire he burns to ashes all the past and future sinful\nreactions of his worshipers by mercifully accepting their offerings.\n47. Just as fire manifests differently in pieces of wood of different sizes and qualities, the omnipotent\nSupreme Soul, having entered the bodies of higher and lower life forms created by His own potency,\nappears to assume the identity of each.\n48. The various phases of one’s material life, beginning with birth and culminating in death, are all\nproperties of the body and do not affect the soul, just as the apparent waxing and waning of the moon does\nnot affect the moon itself. Such changes are enforced by the imperceptible movements of time.\n49. The flames of a fire appear and disappear at every moment, and yet this creation and destruction is not\nnoticed by the ordinary observer.
