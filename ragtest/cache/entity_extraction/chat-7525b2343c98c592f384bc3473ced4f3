{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a machine learning model, specifically designed for extracting entities and relationships from text related to the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture. Here's a breakdown of the content:\n\n**GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT**: This is the main prompt that defines the task for the model. It consists of:\n\n1. An introduction that sets the context and explains the goal of the task.\n2. A step-by-step guide for extracting entities and relationships from the text. Entities should be labeled with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text. Relationships should describe the connections between entities in a philosophical or symbolic way.\n3. Examples of output formats for entities and relationships.\n4. A real-world data section with a text passage from the Bhagavad Gita and the expected output.\n\n**CONTINUE_PROMPT**: This is a continuation prompt that encourages the model to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that might further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n\n**LOOP_PROMPT**: This is a loop prompt that asks the model if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage. The model should answer YES or NO to determine whether to continue the analysis.\n\nOverall, this prompt definition file provides a clear framework for extracting meaningful entities and relationships from text related to the Bhagavad Gita, and encourages the model to continue analyzing the text to uncover deeper insights.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

Thus, both in accepting and giving up the objects of the senses, he is not entangled.\n51. Even when reflected in various objects, the sun is never divided, nor does it merge into its reflection.\nOnly those with dull brains would consider the sun in this way. Similarly, although the soul is reflected\nthrough different material bodies, the soul remains undivided and nonmaterial.\n52. One should never indulge in excessive affection or concern for anyone or anything; otherwise one will\nhave to experience great suffering, just like the foolish pigeon.\n53. There once was a pigeon who lived in the forest along with his wife. He had built a nest within a tree\nand lived there for several years in her company.\n54. The two pigeons were very much devoted to their household duties. Their hearts being tied together by\nsentimental affection, they were each attracted by the other’s glances, bodily features and states of mind.\nThus, they completely bound each other in affection.\n55. Naively trusting in the future, they carried out their acts of resting, sitting, walking, standing, conversing,\nplaying, eating and so forth as a loving couple among the trees of the forest.\n56. Whenever she desired anything, O King, the she-pigeon would flatteringly cajole her husband, and he in\nturn would gratify her by faithfully doing whatever she wanted, even with great personal difficulty. Thus, he\ncould not control\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
