Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

In doing so, if one dies, He attains God and is liberated (from rebirths). Even other heavenly gods must come back to this world but the yogi who understands God is always one with Him and attains moksha (freedom from rebirths, which are cause for sorrow).\n\nThe above is the summary of Bhagavad Gita, chapter eight. It too is short and contains only twenty-eight shlokas (verses). It explains the nature of God and the yogi, the person aspiring for liberation.\nAccording to the Bhagavad Gita, bhakti means devotion to God. Chapter eight explains it a bit. Chapter nine expands on it and talks about Bhakti yoga being superior to jnana yoga (Union of Knowledge). It also says the path of devotion (bhakti) is available to everyone – irrespective of whether one has read the Vedas or not and whether one has a guru or not.\n\nLord Krishna says people who believe in God with unwavering faith are great souls. They seek refuge within Him and know that He is the indestructible origin of all beings. Such souls show utmost respect to God and sing praises of Him, focusing on Him only.\n\nPeople who worship other gods, in fact, worship the Almighty only because He is the receiver of sacrifices, and He is the provider of fruits thereof. Such people attain God in the form they choose\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
