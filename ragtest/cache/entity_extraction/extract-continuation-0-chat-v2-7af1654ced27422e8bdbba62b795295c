Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Yet by creating the forms of trees, reptiles, animals, birds,\nsnakes and so on, the Lord was not satisfied within His heart. Then He created human life, which offers the\nconditioned soul sufficient intelligence to perceive the Absolute Truth, and became pleased.\n29. After many, many births and deaths one achieves the rare human form of life, which, although\ntemporary, affords one the opportunity to attain the highest perfection. Thus a sober human being should\nquickly endeavor for the ultimate perfection of life as long as his body, which is always subject to death, has\nnot fallen down and died. After all, sense gratification is available even in the most abominable species of\nlife, whereas Krsna consciousness is possible only for a human being.\n30. Having learned from my spiritual masters, I remain situated in realization of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead and, fully renounced and enlightened by realized spiritual knowledge, wander the earth without\nattachment or false ego.\n31. Although the Absolute Truth is one without a second, the sages have described Him in many different\nways. Therefore one may not be able to acquire very firm or complete knowledge from one spiritual master.\n32.

The first prompt is used to extract entities and relationships from a given text, specifically from the Bhagavad Gita. The prompt provides instructions on how to identify entities and relationships, including entity types, descriptions, and relationships. The entity types included in the example text are DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, and TEACHING.\n\nThe `GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT` includes three main steps:\n\n1. Identify all entities and extract their information, including name, type, and description.\n2. Identify pairs of related entities and extract their information, including the relationship description and strength.\n3. Return the output as a list of entities and relationships, using **##** as the delimiter.\n\nThe second prompt, `CONTINUE_PROMPT`, encourages the user to continue adding concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n\nThe `LOOP_PROMPT` is a yes/no question that prompts the user whether there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage. This is used to continue the entity extraction and relationship identification process until the user decides to stop.\n\nNote that this script does not contain any logic or implementation to perform the entity extraction and relationship identification tasks.
