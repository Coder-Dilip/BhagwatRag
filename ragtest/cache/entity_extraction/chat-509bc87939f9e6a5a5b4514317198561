{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing task, specifically a graph extraction task. The file provides a detailed description of the task, along with examples and a real data section.\n\nThe task is to extract entities and relationships from a given text passage based on the philosophical and symbolic themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture. The entities and relationships should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the text, and should be labeled with appropriate types and descriptions.\n\nThe task consists of three main steps:\n\n1. Identifying entities: The user should identify all entities in the text, including concepts, symbols, and deities, and extract information such as the entity name, type, and description. Each entity should be formatted as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>).\n2. Identifying relationships: The user should identify all pairs of entities that are clearly related to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way, and extract information such as the source and target entities, relationship description, and relationship strength. Each relationship should be formatted as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>).\n3. Return output: The user should return a list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2, using **##** as the list delimiter.\n\nThe CONTINUE_PROMPT is used to ask the user if there are any additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage.\n\nThe LOOP_PROMPT is used to ask the user if they are ready to continue with the task. If the user responds with YES, the task will continue; if they respond with NO, the task will terminate.\n\nOverall, this prompt definition file provides a clear and detailed description of the task, along with examples and a real data section to help guide the user through the task.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

A saintly person should not think, “This food I will keep to eat tonight and this other food I can save for\ntomorrow.” In other words, a saintly person should not store foodstuffs acquired by begging. Rather, he\nshould use his own hands as his plate and eat whatever fits on them. His only storage container should be his\nbelly, and whatever conveniently fits into his belly should be his stock of food. Thus one should not imitate\nthe greedy honeybee who eagerly collects more and more honey.\n12. A saintly mendicant should not even collect foodstuffs to eat later in the same day or the next day.
