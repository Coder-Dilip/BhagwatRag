Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The prompt is related to the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture, and asks the user to identify entities (such as concepts, deities, virtues, emotions, etc.) and their relationships within the text.\n\nThe prompt consists of four main steps:\n\n1. Identifying entities: The user is asked to identify all entities in the text and labeled them with a unique name, type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, etc.), and a detailed description of the entity's attributes and implications.\n2. Identifying relationships: The user is asked to identify all pairs of related entities and describe the relationship between them, including the strength of the relationship and the causal, representational, or contrastive meanings behind it.\n3. Output: The user is asked to return a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2, separated by **##**.\n4. Confirmation: The user is asked to confirm whether they have extracted all the entities and relationships in the text, or if there are additional ones to explore.\n\nThe prompt also includes examples and real data to help illustrate the types of entities and relationships that might be found in the text.\n\nThe CONTINUE_PROMPT and LOOP_PROMPT are additional guides to help the user continue their analysis. The CONTINUE_PROMPT encourages the user to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that might further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text. The LOOP_PROMPT asks the user if they have identified all the entities and relationships in the text, or if there are additional ones to explore, providing a simple \"YES\" or \"NO\" answer."}]}
