Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Although the performer of fruitive activities desires perpetual happiness, it is clearly observed that\nmaterialistic workers are often unhappy and only occasionally satisfied, thus proving that they are not\nindependent or in control of their destiny. When a person is always under the superior control of another,\nhow can he expect any valuable results from his own fruitive actions?\n18. It is observed within the material world that sometimes even an intelligent person is not happy.\nSimilarly, sometimes even a great fool is happy. The concept of becoming happy through expertly\nperforming material activities is simply a useless exhibition of false egotism.\n19. Even if people know how to achieve happiness and avoid unhappiness, they still do not know the\nprocess by which death will not be able to exert its power over them.\n20. Death is not at all pleasing, and since everyone is exactly like a condemned man being led to the place of\nexecution, what possible happiness can people derive from material objects or the gratification they\nprovide?\n21.
