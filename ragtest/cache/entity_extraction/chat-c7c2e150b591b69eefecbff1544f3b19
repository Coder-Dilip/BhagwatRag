{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) task, specifically for extracting entities and relationships from a text passage inspired by the Bhagavad Gita. The file provides a detailed description of the task, including the goal, steps, and examples.\n\nThe goal is to extract meaningful entities and relationships from the text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth of the Bhagavad Gita. The entities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the text, and the relationships should be based on the philosophical or symbolic connections between the entities.\n\nThe steps involve:\n\n1. Identifying all entities in the text and extracting information about each entity, including its name, type, and description.\n2. Identifying pairs of related entities and extracting information about the relationship between them, including the source and target entities, relationship description, and relationship strength.\n3. Returning the output as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2, using **##** as the list delimiter.\n\nThe file also provides examples of output for two different text passages, as well as a real data section that includes a text passage and expected output.\n\nThe CONTINUE_PROMPT and LOOP_PROMPT variables are used to guide the user through the task, asking if they want to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text, and if they want to continue exploring the passage for additional entities or relationships.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

No one can become an ascetic and yogi just by giving up everything. A yogi must act and perform his prescribed duties.\n\nLord Krishna says to Arjuna that people should use the atman to connect with the paramatman (God). Raise the atman to connect with the paramatman. Atman is atman’s friend and atman may become atman’s foe if not controlled. A person who is connected to paramatman is not deluged by senses.\n\nThe person immersed in yoga sees God in everything he sees. Irrespective of his place, such a yogi is always established in God. Wherever he goes, he finds God. Such a person treats happiness and unhappiness equally and is supreme, according to Lord Krishna. Though the mind is restless, with proper practice and detachment, it can be controlled.\n\nArjuna asks what happens to people who practice yoga but get distracted later. Lord Krishna tells Arjuna that one who tries is never destroyed. Such a person dwells in the world of righteousness and is later born into a wealthy or yogic family so that he can continue his yoga without distractions. He strives again for liberation and achieves it with the grace of God.\n\nThe above is the summary of Bhagavad Gita, chapter six. It talks about three things distinctively: the attributes of a yogi, how he should practice, and what happens when a yogi is distracted\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
