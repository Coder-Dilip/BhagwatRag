{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves extracting entities and relationships from a given text passage. The task is to identify and extract meaningful entities and relationships within a text that is inspired by the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture.\n\nThe prompt provides instructions on how to approach the task, including:\n\n1. Identifying and extracting entities, which are concepts, symbols, or entities that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth of the text. Entities should be labeled with appropriate types, such as DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or others.\n2. Identifying and extracting relationships between entities, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings. Relationships are assigned a numeric score indicating their philosophical significance.\n3. Returning the output as a single list of all entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2, using **##** as the list delimiter.\n\nThe prompt also provides examples of how to format the output and contains a sample text passage from the Bhagavad Gita that the task is based on. The output for this sample passage is also provided as an example.\n\nFinally, the prompt includes three additional strings: CONTINUE_PROMPT, LOOP_PROMPT, and entity_types. CONTINUE_PROMPT is a prompt that encourages the user to add additional concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text. LOOP_PROMPT is a prompt that asks the user if they would like to continue extracting entities and relationships or stop. entity_types is a list of predefined entity types that can be used to label the entities extracted from the text.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

There is nothing above God. Like a string, God holds all the objects in the universe.\n\nGod is above three Gunas (nature), namely: Satva, Rajas, and Tamas. Satva is pure, Rajas wants power, and Tamas is darkness (without knowledge of God). These three Gunas are present in Him but He Himself is above these three Gunas. People who seek refuge in God alone are the ones able to rise above these three Gunas.\n\nThere are four types of people: 1) people who do not know God; 2) those who are suffering; 3) Those who want heaven (satisfaction in this world); and 4) those who know the real nature of God. Out of these four, the last type of man is rare, seeks refuge only in God, and is dear to God.\n\nPeople may pray to other gods desiring lower goals and satisfaction. But the provider of fruits of such prayers is God alone. All paths lead to God.\n\nThus concludes the summary of Bhagavad Gita, chapter seven. It is a short chapter with only thirty verses.\nLord Krishna tells Arjuna that the all-pervading form of God is present in all forms. Its residence in everything is called spirituality (adhyatma). Action (Karma/duties) is the sacrifice that creates and sustains all beings in this world.\n\nOne who thinks of\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
