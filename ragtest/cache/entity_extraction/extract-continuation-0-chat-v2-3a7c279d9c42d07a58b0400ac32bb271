Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The bird who does not eat the fruits of the tree is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who by His\nomniscience perfectly understands His own position and that of the conditioned living entity, represented by\nthe eating bird. That living entity, on the other hand, does not understand himself or the Lord. He is covered\nby ignorance and is thus called eternally conditioned, whereas the Personality of Godhead, being full of\nperfect knowledge, is eternally liberated.\n8. One who is enlightened in self-realization, although living within the material body, sees himself as\ntranscendental to the body, just as one who has arisen from a dream gives up identification with the dream\nbody. A foolish person, however, although not identical with his material body but transcendental to it,\nthinks himself to be situated in the body, just as one who is dreaming sees himself as situated in an\nimaginary body.\n9. An enlightened person who is free from the contamination of material desire does not consider himself to\nbe the performer of bodily activities; rather, he knows that in all such activities it is only the senses, born of\nthe modes of nature, that are contacting sense objects born of the same modes of nature.\n10.

The file contains guidelines for extracting entities and relationships from a given text, specifically from the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe main prompt, `GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT`, outlines the task in four steps:\n\n1. Identify entities in the text, labeling them with their type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT) and description.\n2. Identify relationships between entities, describing the relationship and assigning a strength score.\n3. Return the extracted entities and relationships as a single list, using **##** as a delimiter.\n4.
