Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

What could be more painful for you?\n O son of Kuntī, either you will be killed on the battlefield and attain the heavenly planets, or you will conquer and enjoy the earthly kingdom. Therefore, get up with determination and fight.\n Do thou fight for the sake of fighting, without considering happiness or distress, loss or gain, victory or defeat – and by so doing you shall never incur sin.\n Thus far I have described this knowledge to you through analytical study. Now listen as I explain it in terms of working without fruitive results. O son of Pṛthā, when you act in such knowledge you can free yourself from the bondage of works.\n In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.\n Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one.

The primary goal is to extract entities and relationships from a given text that is inspired by the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture.\n\nThe prompts are divided into four main sections:\n\n1. **GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT**: It provides guidance on extracting entities and relationships from the text. The task involves identifying entities, such as concepts, deities, virtues, emotions, and mindsets, and describing their attributes and symbolic meanings. Relationships between entities are also to be identified, along with a description of their philosophical or symbolic connections.\n\nThe output is expected to be a list of entities and relationships, with each entity described by its name, type, and a detailed description. The relationships are expected to be described by their source and target entities, a description of the relationship, and a score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship.\n\n2. **CONTINUE_PROMPT**: This prompt is used to encourage the model to continue processing the text and extracting entities and relationships.\n\n3. **LOOP_PROMPT**: This prompt is used to determine if the model is done processing the text or if there are additional entities or relationships that need to be extracted.\n\nThe provided examples demonstrate the expected output format for the entities and relationships, as well as how the output should be structured.\n\nOverall, this file provides a clear and comprehensive outline for a natural language processing task that requires the extraction of entities and relationships from a given text inspired by the Bhagavad Gita."}]}
