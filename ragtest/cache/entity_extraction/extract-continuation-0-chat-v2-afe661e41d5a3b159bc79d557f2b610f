Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The file contains instructions for the task and provides examples of output.\n\nThe prompt defines a three-step process:\n\n1. Entity extraction: Identify all entities within the text and extract their type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING) and a detailed description of the entity's attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications.\n2. Relationship identification: Identify pairs of related entities and extract the source and target entities, their relationship description, and a numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship.\n3. Output formatting: Return the extracted entities and relationships in a single list, using **##** as the list delimiter, and indicate completion with `<|COMPLETE|>`.\n\nThe examples provided demonstrate the expected output format for both individual entities and relationships.\n\nThe file also defines three prompts to guide the NLP task:\n\n1. **CONTINUE_PROMPT**: A prompt to encourage the continuance of the entity and relationship extraction process, inviting the addition of remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n2. **LOOP_PROMPT**: A loop prompt to ask if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage, with options to answer YES or NO.\n\nBy analyzing this file, we can understand the requirements for extracting entities and relationships from the Bhagavad Gita text and identify the expected output format and prompts for the NLP task."}]}
