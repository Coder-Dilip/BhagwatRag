Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Out of\nanxiety she would sometimes walk out toward the street, and sometimes she went back into her house. In\nthis way, the midnight hour gradually arrived.\n27. As the night wore on, the prostitute, who intensely desired money, gradually became morose, and her\nface dried up. Thus being filled with anxiety for money and most disappointed, she began to feel a great\ndetachment from her situation, and happiness arose in her mind.\n28. The prostitute felt disgusted with her material situation and thus became indifferent to it. Indeed,\ndetachment acts like a sword, cutting to pieces the binding network of material hopes and desires. Now\nplease hear from me the song sung by the prostitute in that situation.\n29. O King, just as a human being who is bereft of spiritual knowledge never desires to give up his false\nsense of proprietorship over many material things, similarly, a person who has not developed detachment\nnever desires to give up the bondage of the material body.\n30.
