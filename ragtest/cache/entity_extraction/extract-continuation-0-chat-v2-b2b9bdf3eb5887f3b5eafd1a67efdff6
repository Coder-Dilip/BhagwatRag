Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Trade and agriculture are natural actions for vaishyas. Servitude is the natural action for Shudras.\n\nPeople who perform their natural actions without attachment are liberated. Performing one’s own actions imperfectly is better compared to performing others’ actions perfectly. With their minds fixed on God, knowing that God pervades everything, if they perform their own actions, they are liberated from the cycle of rebirths.\n\nGod is established in all beings and appears different because of Maya (illusion). Lord Krishna asks Arjuna to focus on Him by all means and, in every way, seek refuge in Him alone. Through His blessings, Arjuna or any other karma yogi can attain Supreme Tranquillity and the Supreme Abode.\n\nLord Krishna tells Arjuna that whoever reads theBhagavad Gita and explains it to others is bound to be liberated because such a person will be praying to God using jnana yoga (knowledge yoga).\n\nSanjaya, who was listening to the entire conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna, tells Dhristrashtra that wherever there is yogi like Lord Krishna and a devotee like Arjuna, there can only be victory and nothing else.
