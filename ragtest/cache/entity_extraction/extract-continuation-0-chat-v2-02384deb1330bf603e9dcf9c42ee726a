Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Although the sky, or space, is the resting place of everything, the sky does not mix with anything, nor\nis it entangled. Similarly, the sun is not at all attached to the water in which it is reflected within\ninnumerable reservoirs, and the mighty wind blowing everywhere is not affected by the innumerable aromas\nand atmospheres through which it passes. In the same way, a self-realized soul is completely detached from\nthe material body and the material world around it. He is like a person who has awakened and arisen from a\ndream. With expert vision sharpened by detachment, the self-realized soul cuts all doubts to pieces through\nknowledge of the self and completely withdraws his consciousness from the expansion of material variety.\n14. A person is considered to be completely liberated from the gross and subtle material bodies when all the\nfunctions of his vital energy, senses, mind and intelligence are performed without material desire. Such a\nperson, although situated within the body, is not entangled.\n15. Sometimes for no apparent reason one’s body is attacked by cruel people or violent animals. At other\ntimes and in other places, one will suddenly be offered great respect or worship. One who becomes neither\nangry when attacked nor satisfied when worshiped is actually intelligent.\n16.
