{"result": "This is a file containing prompts definition for a task related to extracting entities and relationships from a text inspired by the Bhagavad Gita. The prompts are designed to guide the extraction process and provide a framework for identifying and labeling entities, as well as describing their relationships.\n\nThe main prompt is divided into four steps:\n\n1. Identify entities: Extract entities from the text, including their names, types, and descriptions. The entities can be concepts, deities, people, virtues, emotions, mindsets, actions, or teachings.\n2. Identify relationships: Identify pairs of entities that are related to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way. For each pair, extract the source and target entities, as well as a description of the relationship and its strength.\n3. Return output: Return the extracted entities and relationships in a single list, using **##** as the list delimiter.\n4. Completion: When finished, output `<|COMPLETE|>`.\n\nThe prompts also include examples and real data to illustrate the expected output format and the types of entities and relationships that can be extracted.\n\nThe CONTINUE_PROMPT is used to encourage the user to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n\nThe LOOP_PROMPT is used to ask the user if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage. The user can answer YES or NO to indicate whether they want to continue extracting entities and relationships.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

But even this result, which is only achieved by perfect\nperformance of fruitive rituals, will be vanquished by time. Now hear of this.\n23. If on earth one performs sacrifices for the satisfaction of the demigods, he goes to the heavenly planets,\nwhere, just like a demigod, he enjoys all of the heavenly pleasures he has earned by his performances.\n24. Having achieved the heavenly planets, the performer of ritualistic sacrifices travels in a glowing\nairplane, which he obtains as the result of his piety on earth. Being glorified by songs sung by the\nGandharvas and dressed in wonderfully charming clothes, he enjoys life surrounded by heavenly goddesses.\n25. Accompanied by heavenly women, the enjoyer of the fruits of sacrifice goes on pleasure rides in a\nwonderful airplane, which is decorated with circles of tinkling bells and which flies wherever he desires.\nBeing relaxed, comfortable and happy in the heavenly pleasure gardens, he does not consider that he is\nexhausting the fruits of his piety and will soon fall down to the mortal world.\n26. Until his pious results are used up, the performer of sacrifice enjoys life in the heavenly planets. When\nthe pious results are exhausted, however, he falls down from the pleasure gardens of heaven, being moved\nagainst his desire by the force of eternal time.\n27-29.
