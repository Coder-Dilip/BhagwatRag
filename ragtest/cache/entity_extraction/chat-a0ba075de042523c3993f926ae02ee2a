{"result": "This script provides a set of prompts for extracting meaningful entities and relationships from a given text, specifically focused on the Bhagavad Gita. The prompts are divided into four main steps:\n\n1. **Entity Extraction**: Identify all entities in the text and extract the following information for each:\n\t* Entity name\n\t* Entity type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING)\n\t* Entity description\n2. **Relationship Identification**: Identify all pairs of related entities and extract the following information for each:\n\t* Source entity\n\t* Target entity\n\t* Relationship description\n\t* Relationship strength (numeric score indicating the philosophical significance)\n3. **Output**: Return a list of all identified entities and relationships, formatted as a series of tuples with the specified slots.\n4. **Continue/Loop**: Offer the option to continue extracting concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n\nThe script provides examples of output for two given texts and includes a sample text from the Bhagavad Gita. The `REAL DATA` section contains relevant data for entity types, text, and expected output.\n\nThe `CONTINUE_PROMPT` and `LOOP_PROMPT` variables can be used to guide the user through the extraction process, offering options to continue or loop through the prompts as needed.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

All paths lead to God.\n\nThus concludes the summary of Bhagavad Gita, chapter seven. It is a short chapter with only thirty verses.\nLord Krishna tells Arjuna that the all-pervading form of God is present in all forms. Its residence in everything is called spirituality (adhyatma). Action (Karma/duties) is the sacrifice that creates and sustains all beings in this world.\n\nOne who thinks of God at the time of his death, attains God. Therefore, always immerse yourself in thoughts of God. One should think of God as the omniscient, without beginning and end, finer than the finest, upholder of everything, with a form that is beyond senses, self-radiant, and beyond the darkness.\n\nYogis aspiring for liberation should use all their senses to control their mind and heart. They must do pranayama for the balance of breath, practice celibacy, and constantly utter the syllable “OM”. In doing so, if one dies, He attains God and is liberated (from rebirths). Even other heavenly gods must come back to this world but the yogi who understands God is always one with Him and attains moksha (freedom from rebirths, which are cause for sorrow).\n\nThe above is the summary of Bhagavad Gita, chapter eight. It too is short and contains only twenty-eight shlok\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
