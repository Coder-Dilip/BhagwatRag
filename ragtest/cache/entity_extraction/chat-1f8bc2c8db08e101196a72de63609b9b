{"result": "This appears to be a prompt definition for a natural language processing (NLP) task, specifically a graph extraction task. The prompt defines a task where the input is a given text passage from the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture, and the goal is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within the text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nThe prompt provides a detailed outline of the task, including:\n\n1. Identifying entities: The task requires the identification of various types of entities, including concepts, deities, people, virtues, emotions, mindsets, actions, and teachings. Each entity should be labeled with a type and a detailed description of its attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications.\n2. Identifying relationships: The task also requires the identification of relationships between entities, including causal, representational, and contrastive relationships. Each relationship should be labeled with a description of the connection between the source and target entities and a numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship.\n3. Output format: The output should be a single list of all the identified entities and relationships, with each entity and relationship formatted in a specific way.\n\nThe prompt provides examples of expected output and a real data example to illustrate the task. The CONTINUE_PROMPT and LOOP_PROMPT provide additional instructions for the user to continue adding concepts, symbols, or entities and to check for additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. He explains the nature of duty, selflessness, and the eternal soul.\n######################\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>KRISHNA<|>DEITY<|>Krishna is the supreme deity who provides wisdom and guidance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARJUNA<|>PERSON<|>A warrior seeking guidance on duty and life)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUTY<|>CONCEPT<|>The principle of fulfilling one's responsibilities without attachment to outcomes)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KRISHNA<|>ARJUNA<|>Krishna guides Arjuna in understanding his duty<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KRISHNA<|>DUTY<|>Krishna imparts the concept of duty as essential for spiritual growth<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\nExample 2:\nText:\nArjuna experiences intense inner conflict, torn between his warrior duty and his compassion for family members on the opposing side.\n######################\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>ARJUNA<|>PERSON<|>Arjuna is a warrior experiencing moral and emotional conflict)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUTY<|>CONCEPT<|>The concept of duty as Arjuna’s responsibility as a warrior)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPASSION<|>VIRTUE<|>A virtue that causes Arjuna emotional turmoil on the battlefield)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUTY<|>COMPASSION<|>Duty and compassion create an inner conflict within Arjuna<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Real Data-\n######################\nEntity_types: DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING\nText: the soul, free of happiness and unhappiness, such a person goes to God, the indestructible goal.\n\nLord Krishna tells Arjuna that He is the energy that lights up the sun, moon, and fire. He is the fire of digestion in individual bodies and helps digest food. He is the knower of Vedas and the origin of Vedanta.\n\nThe people who know Him to be the Supreme Being, are omniscient and worship Him in every way possible.\n\nThis is a small chapter and doesn’t contain much philosophy. Thus ends the summary ofBhagavad Gita, chapter 15. The next chapter is also short and explains the characteristics of good and bad.\n\nLord Krishna says to Arjuna that people who possess the following characteristics are of divine quality:\n\nabsence of fear,\npure heart,\nsteadiness in jnana (knowledge) and karma yoga (action),\nsacrifices (yajna),\nausterities,\nsimplicity,\ndon’t injure others,\ntruthfulness,\nlack of anger,\nlack of criticism,\ncompassion,\nforgiveness,\ncleanliness,\nabsence of hatred, and\nabsence of ego.\nHe then explains the characteristics that make a person of demonic quality:\n\narrogance,\ninsolence,\nego,\nanger,\ncruelty, and\nignorance.\nDemonic people don’t know about good and bad actions. There is no purity in them. They can’t be truthful and righteous\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
