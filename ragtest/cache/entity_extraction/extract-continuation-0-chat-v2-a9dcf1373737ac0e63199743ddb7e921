Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

My dear King, Uddhava was a constantly faithful follower of Lord Krsna. Upon seeing the imminent\ndeparture of the Yadavas, hearing from them of the Lord’s instructions and taking note of the fearful omens,\nhe approached the Personality of Godhead in a private place. He bowed down with his head at the lotus feet\nof the supreme controller of the universe and with folded hands addressed Him as follows.\n42. Sri Uddhava said: O my Lord, O supreme God among all the demigods, real piety is invoked simply by\nhearing and chanting Your transcendental glories. My Lord, it appears that You will now withdraw Your\ndynasty, and thus You Yourself will finally give up Your pastimes within this universe. You are the\nsupreme controller and the master of all mystic power. But although You are fully capable of counteracting\nthe brahmanas’ curse against Your dynasty, You are not doing so, and Your disappearance is imminent.\n43. O Lord Kesava, my dear master, I cannot tolerate giving up Your lotus feet even for a fraction of a\nmoment. I urge You to take me along with You to Your own abode.\n44. O my dear Krsna, Your pastimes are supremely auspicious for mankind and are an intoxicating beverage\nfor the ears. Tasting such pastimes, people forget their desires for other things.\n45.\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
