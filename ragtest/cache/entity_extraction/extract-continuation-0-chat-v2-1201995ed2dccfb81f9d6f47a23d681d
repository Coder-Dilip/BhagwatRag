Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

In fact, you\nshould know that all of the objects of the material senses are temporary.\n8. One whose consciousness is bewildered by illusion perceives many differences in value and meaning\namong material objects. Thus one engages constantly on the platform of material good and evil and is bound\nby such conceptions. Absorbed in material duality, such a person contemplates the performance of\ncompulsory duties, nonperformance of such duties and performance of forbidden activities.\n9. Therefore, bringing all your senses under control and thus subduing the mind, you should see the entire\nworld as situated within the self, who is expanded everywhere, and you should also see this individual self\nwithin Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n10. Being fully endowed with conclusive knowledge of the Vedas and having realized the ultimate purpose\nof such knowledge in practice, you will be able to perceive the pure self, and thus your mind will be\nsatisfied. At that time you will become dear to all living beings, headed by the demigods, and you will never\nbe hampered by any disturbance in life.\n11. One who has transcended material good and evil automatically acts in accordance with religious\ninjunctions and avoids forbidden activities.
