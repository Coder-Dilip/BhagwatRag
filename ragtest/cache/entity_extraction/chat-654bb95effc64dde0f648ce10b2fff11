{"result": "This is a file containing prompts definition for a task that involves extracting meaningful entities and relationships from a given text. The text is inspired by the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references.\n\nThe task consists of four steps:\n\n1. Identifying entities: The user is asked to identify all entities in the text and extract information such as entity name, type, and description. The type of entities can include concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets.\n\n2. Identifying relationships: The user is asked to identify pairs of related entities and extract information such as the source and target entities, relationship description, and relationship strength.\n\n3. Output: The user is asked to return the output in the form of a list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2, separated by \"**##**\".\n\n4. Continuation: The user is then asked if they want to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n\nAdditionally, there are two example prompts provided: Example 1 and Example 2. These examples demonstrate the format of the output for the entities and relationships identified in the text.\n\nThe output is expected to be in English, and the user is given the option to continue adding concepts, symbols, or entities to further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n\nThe CONTINUE_PROMPT and LOOP_PROMPT are used to guide the user through the task and to gather additional information if needed.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

The pigeon and his wife were always anxious for the maintenance of their children, and they were\nwandering in the forest for that purpose. Having obtained proper food, they now returned to their nest.\n65. When the lady pigeon caught sight of her own children trapped within the hunter’s net, she was\noverwhelmed with anguish, and crying out, she rushed toward them as they cried out to her in return.\n66. The lady pigeon had always allowed herself to be bound by the ropes of intense material affection, and\nthus her mind was overwhelmed by anguish. Being in the grip of the illusory energy of the Lord, she\ncompletely forgot herself, and rushing forward to her helpless children, she was immediately bound in the\nhunter’s net.\n67. Seeing his own children, who were more dear to him than life itself, fatally bound in the hunter’s net\nalong with his dearmost wife, whom he considered equal in every way to himself, the poor male pigeon\nbegan to lament wretchedly.\n68. The male pigeon said: Alas, just see how I am now destroyed! I am obviously a great fool, for I did not\nproperly execute pious activities. I could not satisfy myself, nor could I fulfill the purpose of life. My dear\nfamily, which was the basis of my religiosity, economic development and sense gratification, is now\nhopelessly ruined.\n69.\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
