{"result": "This prompt is for a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves extracting entities and relationships from a given text passage. The passage appears to be from the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture. The goal is to identify the entities and relationships within the text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth of the scripture.\n\nThe task involves the following steps:\n\n1. Identify all entities in the text and extract the following information for each entity:\n\t* entity_name: The name of the entity, capitalized\n\t* entity_type: The type of entity, which can be one of the following: DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the Bhagavad Gita\n\t* entity_description: A detailed description of the entity's attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications, including interpretations where relevant\n2. Identify all pairs of related entities (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\n\t* source_entity: The name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n\t* target_entity: The name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n\t* relationship_description: An explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable\n\t* relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection\n3. Return the output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2, using **##** as the list delimiter.\n4. When finished, output `<|COMPLETE|>`\n\nThe prompt provides two examples of how the output should look like. The first example involves a passage about Krishna guiding Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, while the second example involves a passage about Arjuna experiencing intense inner conflict.\n\nThe real data prompt contains a passage from the Bhagavad Gita, and the goal is to extract entities and relationships from this passage using the same steps as before.\n\nFinally, there are two additional prompts: CONTINUE_PROMPT and LOOP_PROMPT. The CONTINUE_PROMPT is used to encourage the user to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text. The LOOP_PROMPT is used to ask the user if they want to continue extracting entities and relationships from the text, or if they are finished.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

He is my enemy, and I have killed him, and my other enemies will also be killed. I am the lord of everything. I am the enjoyer. I am perfect, powerful and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am. I shall perform sacrifices, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice.” In this way, such persons are deluded by ignorance.\n Thus perplexed by various anxieties and bound by a network of illusions, they become too strongly attached to sense enjoyment and fall down into hell.\n Self-complacent and always impudent, deluded by wealth and false prestige, they sometimes proudly perform sacrifices in name only, without following any rules or regulations.\n Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demons become envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in their own bodies and in the bodies of others, and blaspheme against the real religion.\n Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, I perpetually cast into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.\n Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life, O son of Kuntī, such persons can never approach Me.
