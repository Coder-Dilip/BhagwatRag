{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a task in the field of natural language processing (NLP) or artificial intelligence (AI). The task appears to be extracting entities and their relationships from a text passage inspired by the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture.\n\nThe file defines several key components:\n\n1. `GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT`: This is the main prompt that describes the task. It outlines the goal, steps, and expected output format. The task involves identifying entities, such as concepts, symbols, and deities, and their relationships. The entities should be labeled with appropriate types and descriptions, and the relationships should be described with a relationship description and relationship strength score.\n2. `CONTINUE_PROMPT`: This is a prompt for adding additional concepts, symbols, or entities that can further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n3. `LOOP_PROMPT`: This is a prompt for determining whether there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage.\n\nThe example outputs and text passage are provided to illustrate the expected format and content of the output.\n\nThe entity types mentioned are:\n\n* DEITY\n* PERSON\n* CONCEPT\n* VIRTUE\n* EMOTION\n* MINDSET\n* ACTION\n* TEACHING\n\nThe relationship strengths are scored on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being a minor or interpretative connection and 10 being a foundational relationship.\n\nOverall, this task seems to be about extracting meaningful concepts and relationships from a philosophical text and representing them in a structured format.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Those who reach it never return to this material world.\nThe living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.\nThe living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of life from one body to another, as the air carries aromas. Thus he takes one kind of body and again quits it to take another.\nThe living entity, thus taking another gross body, obtains a certain type of ear, eye, tongue, nose and sense of touch, which are grouped about the mind. He thus enjoys a particular set of sense objects.\n The foolish cannot understand how a living entity can quit his body, nor can they understand what sort of body he enjoys under the spell of the modes of nature.
