{"result": "This is a code definition file for a text-based AI model that extracts entities and relationships from a passage of text inspired by the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture. The model is designed to identify and extract meaningful entities and relationships within the text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nThe code defines four main prompts:\n\n1. `GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT`: This is the main prompt that guides the model's extraction process. It explains the goal and steps for identifying entities and relationships in the text.\n2. `CONTINUE_PROMPT`: This prompt is used when the model finishes extracting entities and relationships and prompts the user to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n3. `LOOP_PROMPT`: This prompt is used to ask the user if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage. The user can respond with either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nThe code also provides two examples of output (`Example 1` and `Example 2`) to illustrate how the model should extract entities and relationships from a given text passage.\n\nThe `Real Data` section provides a sample text passage and expected output for the model to demonstrate its functionality.\n\nThe `Entity_types` section lists the expected entity types that the model should identify, including:\n\n* DEITY\n* PERSON\n* CONCEPT\n* VIRTUE\n* EMOTION\n* MINDSET\n* ACTION\n* TEACHING", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Pṛthā.\n Men in this world desire success in fruitive activities, and therefore they worship the demigods. Quickly, of course, men get results from fruitive work in this world.\n According to the three modes of material nature and the work associated with them, the four divisions of human society are created by Me. And although I am the creator of this system, you should know that I am yet the nondoer, being unchangeable.\n There is no work that affects Me; nor do I aspire for the fruits of action. One who understands this truth about Me also does not become entangled in the fruitive reactions of work.\n All the liberated souls in ancient times acted with this understanding of My transcendental nature. Therefore you should perform your duty, following in their footsteps.\n Even the intelligent are bewildered in determining what is action and what is inaction. Now I shall explain to you what action is, knowing which you shall be liberated from all misfortune.\n The intricacies of action are very hard to understand. Therefore one should know properly what action is, what forbidden action is and what inaction is.\n One who sees inaction in action and action in inaction is intelligent among men, and he is in the transcendental position, although engaged in all sorts of activities.\n One is understood to be in full knowledge whose every endeavor is devoid of\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
