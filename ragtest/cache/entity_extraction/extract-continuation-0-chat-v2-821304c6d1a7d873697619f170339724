Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

It cannot be killed by the sword; it cannot be burned by fire; it cannot be wet by water; wind cannot dry it; the soul is eternal and stable.\n\nThe teachings of Sri Krishna then turn to Karma Yoga. He says that the karma of Arjuna is to fight, and hence he should fight the enemies. In doing his karma (action/duties), sin will not accrue because he is just doing what he is supposed to do. He tells Arjuna that people have the right to action alone and not to the fruits of the action. Therefore, karma (action) should be done without any attachment to its fruit. Such action keeps people safe from sin.\n\nHe further teaches that people who do not waver during bouts of pleasure and pain are the ones who have controlled their senses. Desires are bad for karma yoga and bring about destruction. Anger gives birth to delusion and delusion leads to confusion. Confusion leads to loss of intellect and brings destruction. Therefore, one must strive to control one’s desires and, thereby, one’s senses.\n\nThis is the summary of Bhagavad Gita, chapter two. The next chapter is about the teachings of Sri Krishna about Karma Yoga (action) that leads to God.\n\nAction without the desire for an outcome (the fruits of karma/action) does not accrue sins. No one can live without action.
