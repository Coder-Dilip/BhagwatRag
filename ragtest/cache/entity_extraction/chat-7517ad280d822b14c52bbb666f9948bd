{"result": "This text appears to be a set of prompts for a language model to extract meaningful entities and relationships from a provided text, specifically focusing on the religious and philosophical themes of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT defines the task, explains the concepts and requirements, and provides examples of output. The prompt is divided into four sections:\n\n1. **Goal**: Explains the objective of the task, which is to extract entities and relationships that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth of the text.\n2. **Steps**: Outlines the tasks to be performed:\n    * Step 1: Identify all entities, including their type and a detailed description.\n    * Step 2: Identify relationships between entities, including a description of the relationship and a strength score indicating its philosophical significance.\n    * Step 3: Return the output in a single list, using **##** as the list delimiter.\n    * Step 4: Output \"<|COMPLETE|>\" when finished.\n3. **Examples**: Provides two examples of output for different texts, including the input text and the expected output.\n4. **Real Data**: Offers some real data (sentences from the Bhagavad Gita) for the model to work with and some predefined entity types (DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING).\n\nThe CONTINUE_PROMPT and LOOP_PROMPT are additional texts that can be used to guide the language model's output, encouraging it to further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text and to consider additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further insights.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

The persons I have mentioned did not undergo serious studies of the Vedic literature, nor did they\nworship great saintly persons, nor did they execute severe vows or austerities. Simply by association with\nMe and My devotees, they achieved Me.\n8. The inhabitants of Vrndavana, including the gopis, cows, unmoving creatures such as the twin arjuna\ntrees, animals, living entities with stunted consciousness such as bushes and thickets, and snakes such as\nKaliya, all achieved the perfection of life by unalloyed love for Me and thus very easily achieved Me.\n9. Even though one engages with great endeavor in the mystic yoga system, philosophical speculation,\ncharity, vows, penances, ritualistic sacrifices, teaching of Vedic mantras to others, personal study of the\nVedas, or the renounced order of life, still one cannot achieve Me.\n10. The residents of Vrndavana, headed by the gopis, were always completely attached to Me with deepest\nlove. Therefore, when My uncle Akrura brought My brother Balarama and Me to the city of Mathura, the\nresidents of Vrndavana suffered extreme mental distress because of separation from Me and could not find\nany other source of happiness.\n11. Dear Uddhava, all of those nights that the gopis spent with Me\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
