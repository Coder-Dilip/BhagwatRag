Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Satvik food increases joy and pleasure, increases life expectancy, removes diseases, and is pure. Rajasik food is bitter, acidic, salty, dry, and burning. Such type of Rajasik food increases unhappiness, sorrow, and diseases. Tamasik food is stale and tasted by others already; it increases impurities.\n\nSacrifices too are of three types. Sacrifices performed according to Vedas, that are pacifying to the mind, performed without attachment towards outcome, are of Sattva type. Sacrifices performed for materialistic returns are of Rajas type. Sacrifices performed without prescribed rites in Vedas, performed without mantras and donations, and without faith are said to be of Tamas type.\n\nAusterities are also of three types. Physical austerities include the worship of gods and teachers (gurus). They include celibacy (brahmacharya), purity, and non-violence. Verbal austerities include not using words that cause anxiety, speaking the truth, and speech that leads to peace and welfare. The calmness of mind, absence of cruelty, and purity in attitude are known as mental austerities. These three types of austerities are of Sattva type. Austerities taken up for praise, respect, or worship are of Rajas type. Austerities that lead to pain and destruction of others are of Tamas type.\n\nGod, the Creator\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?

The prompts are related to extracting entities and relationships from a given text, specifically from the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture.\n\nThe prompts are structured into four main sections:\n\n1. `GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT`: This is the main prompt for the entity recognition and relationship extraction task. It provides instructions on how to identify entities (concepts, symbols, individuals, etc.) in the text and extract information about them, such as their type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, etc.) and description. Additionally, it asks to identify relationships between these entities and describe the nature of those relationships.\n2. `CONTINUE_PROMPT`: This prompt is intended to be used when the AI model has already extracted some entities and relationships, but there are still more to be discovered. It encourages the AI model to continue exploring the text to find additional concepts, symbols, or entities that can add depth to the understanding of the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n3. `LOOP_PROMPT`: This prompt is used to determine whether the AI model should continue searching for entities and relationships or stop the process.\n\nThe script also includes two example outputs, `Example 1` and `Example 2`, to illustrate how the entity recognition and relationship extraction task should be performed."}]}
