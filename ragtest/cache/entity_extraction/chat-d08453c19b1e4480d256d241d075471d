{"result": "This appears to be a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) task, specifically for extracting entities and relationships from a given text. The file defines several prompts and examples to guide the extraction process.\n\nThe main prompt, `GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT`, outlines the task and provides guidance on how to extract entities and relationships from the text. It mentions the importance of capturing the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth of the text, which is inspired by the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe prompt defines several steps:\n\n1. Identify entities and extract information such as entity name, type, and description.\n2. Identify relationships between entities and extract information such as relationship description and strength.\n3. Return the output as a single list of entities and relationships.\n\nThe prompt provides examples and a format for the output.\n\nThe `CONTINUE_PROMPT` is a follow-up question that asks the user to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that may clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n\nThe `LOOP_PROMPT` is a loop prompt that asks the user if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights. The user can respond with \"YES\" or \"NO.\"\n\nOverall, this file appears to be designed to guide the extraction of semantic information from a text, with a focus on capturing the philosophical and symbolic meanings behind the text.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Oh, how I have uselessly tortured my own soul! I have sold my body to lusty, greedy men who are\nthemselves objects of pity. Thus practicing the most abominable profession of a prostitute, I hoped to get\nmoney and sex pleasure.\n33. This material body is like a house in which I, the soul, am living. The bones forming my spine, ribs,\narms and legs are like the beams, crossbeams and pillars of the house, and the whole structure, which is full\nof stool and urine, is covered by skin, hair and nails. The nine doors leading into this body are constantly\nexcreting foul substances. Besides me, what woman could be so foolish as to devote herself to this material\nbody, thinking that she might find pleasure and love in this contraption?\n34. Certainly in this city of Videha I alone am completely foolish. I neglected the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, who awards us everything, even our original spiritual form, and instead I desired to enjoy sense\ngratification with many men.\n35. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is absolutely the most dear one for all living beings because He is\neveryone’s well-wisher and Lord. He is the Supreme Soul situated in everyone’s heart.
