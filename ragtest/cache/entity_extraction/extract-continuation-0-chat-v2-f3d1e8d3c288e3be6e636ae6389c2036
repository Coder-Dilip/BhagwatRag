Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

A faithful person who constantly hears, glorifies and remembers such transcendental activities,\nwho through dramatic performances relives My pastimes, beginning with My appearance, and who takes\nfull shelter of Me, dedicating his religious, sensual and occupational activities for My satisfaction, certainly\nobtains unflinching devotional service to Me, the eternal Personality of Godhead.\n25. One who has obtained pure devotional service by association with My devotees always engages in\nworshiping Me. Thus he very easily goes to My abode, which is revealed by My pure devotees.\n26-27. Sri Uddhava said: My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, what type of person do You\nconsider to be a true devotee, and what type of devotional service is approved by great devotees as worthy\nof being offered to Your Lordship? My dear ruler of the universal controllers, O Lord of Vaikuntha and\nalmighty God of the universe, I am Your devotee, and because I love You I have no other shelter than You.\nTherefore please explain this to me.\n28.
