Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Because you are My dear friend, for your benefit I shall speak to you further, giving knowledge that is better than what I have already explained.\nNeither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin or opulences, for, in every respect, I am the source of the demigods and sages.\nHe who knows Me as the unborn, as the beginningless, as the Supreme Lord of all the worlds – he only, undeluded among men, is freed from all sins.\n5: Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from doubt and delusion, forgiveness, truthfulness, control of the senses, control of the mind, happiness and distress, birth, death, fear, fearlessness, nonviolence, equanimity, satisfaction, austerity, charity, fame and infamy – all these various qualities of living beings are created by Me alone.\nThe seven great sages and before them the four other great sages and the Manus [progenitors of mankind] come from Me, born from My mind, and all the living beings populating the various planets descend from them.\nOne who is factually convinced of this opulence and mystic power of Mine engages in unalloyed devotional service; of this there is no doubt.\nI am the source of all spiritual and material worlds.

The prompt is focused on the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture, and is designed to identify entities and relationships that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth of the text.\n\nThe prompt consists of four main steps:\n\n1. Identify entities in the text, extracting their name, type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT), and description.\n2. From the identified entities, identify pairs of entities that are clearly related to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way, extracting information about the source and target entities, the relationship between them, and the strength of the relationship.\n3. Return the output as a single list of all identified entities and relationships, using **##** as the list delimiter.\n4. Output **|COMPLETE|** when finished.\n\nThe prompt also includes examples of possible output and a real data section that provides sample text and expected output.\n\nThe CONTINUE_PROMPT and LOOP_PROMPT are used to guide the process of extracting entities and relationships, encouraging the user to continue adding concepts, symbols, and entities until they are satisfied that they have captured all the relevant information.\n\nOverall, this prompt provides a clear and detailed framework for extracting meaningful entities and relationships from a given text passage, with a focus on philosophical and symbolic analysis."}]}
