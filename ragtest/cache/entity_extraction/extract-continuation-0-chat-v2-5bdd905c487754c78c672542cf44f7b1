Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The living entity is explained as the superior prakṛti. Prakṛti is always under control, whether inferior or superior. Prakṛti is female, and she is controlled by the Lord just as the activities of a wife are controlled by the husband. Prakṛti is always subordinate, predominated by the Lord, who is the predominator. The living entities and material nature are both predominated, controlled by the Supreme Lord. According to the Gītā, the living entities, although parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are to be considered prakṛti. This is clearly mentioned in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gītā. Apareyam itas tv anyāṁ prakṛtiṁ viddhi me parām/ jīva-bhūtām: “This material nature is My inferior prakṛti, but beyond this is another prakṛti – jīva-bhūtām, the living entities.”\n\nMaterial nature itself is constituted by three qualities: the mode of goodness, the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance.
