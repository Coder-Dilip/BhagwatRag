Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

And even if only two\npeople live together there will be frivolous conversation and disagreement. Therefore, to avoid conflict, one\nshould live alone, as we learn from the example of the bracelet of the young girl.\n11. Having perfected the yoga sitting postures and conquered the breathing process, one should make the\nmind steady by detachment and the regulated practice of yoga. Thus one should carefully fix the mind on\nthe single goal of yoga practice.\n12. The mind can be controlled when it is fixed on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Having achieved a\nstable situation, the mind becomes free from polluted desires to execute material activities; thus as the mode\nof goodness increases in strength, one can completely give up the modes of passion and ignorance, and\ngradually one transcends even the material mode of goodness. When the mind is freed from the fuel of the\nmodes of nature, the fire of material existence is extinguished. Then one achieves the transcendental\nplatform of direct relationship with the object of his meditation, the Supreme Lord.\n13. Thus, when one’s consciousness is completely fixed on the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, one no longer sees duality, or internal and external reality. The example is given of the arrow\nmaker who was so absorbed in making a straight arrow that he did not even see or notice the king himself,\nwho was passing right next to him.\n14.
