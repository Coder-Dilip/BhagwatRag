{"result": "This is a file containing prompts definition for a task related to extracting entities and relationships from text in the context of the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture.\n\nThe main prompt is a set of instructions that outlines what the task involves:\n\n* Extraction of entities from the text, which can include concepts, deities, persons, emotions, virtues, mindsets, actions, and teachings.\n* Identification of relationships between these entities, including causal, representational, and contrastive relationships.\n* The relationships should be scored based on their philosophical significance, with a higher score indicating a more foundational relationship.\n\nThe output should be in the form of a list of entities and relationships, with each entity represented by a string in the format \"entity<|>name<|>type<|>description\" and each relationship represented by a string in the format \"relationship<|>source_entity<|>target_entity<|>description<|>relationship_strength\". The output should be terminated by the string \"|\"COMPLETE|\".\n\nThe file also includes examples of output for different input texts, as well as a section called \"Real Data\" that provides a sample text and the expected output.\n\nAdditionally, there are two other prompts:\n\n* CONTINUE_PROMPT: This is a prompt to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n* LOOP_PROMPT: This is a prompt to ask if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage, with the options to answer YES or NO.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.
