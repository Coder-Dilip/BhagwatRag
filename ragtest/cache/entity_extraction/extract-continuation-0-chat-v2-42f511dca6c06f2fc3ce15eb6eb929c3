Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Although the perfected beings offer You their respectful homage, the demons are afraid, and they flee here and there. All this is rightly done.\n O great one, greater even than Brahmā, You are the original creator. Why then should they not offer their respectful obeisances unto You?

The GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT is a detailed instruction on how to extract meaningful entities and relationships from a given text, specifically from or inspired by the Bhagavad Gita. The prompt outlines the steps to identify entities, extract their attributes, and identify relationships between them. The prompt also provides examples of output format.\n\nThe CONTINUE_PROMPT is a continuation of the GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT and asks the user to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n\nThe LOOP_PROMPT is a loop control prompt that asks the user if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage. The answer to this prompt (YES or NO) will determine whether the loop continues or terminates.\n\nThe script appears to be designed for a natural language processing (NLP) task, such as text analysis or information extraction, and is likely used in a specific project or application."}]}
