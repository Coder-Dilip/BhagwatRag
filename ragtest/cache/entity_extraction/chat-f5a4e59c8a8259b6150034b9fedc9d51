{"result": "This appears to be a prompt definition file for a machine learning model, specifically for extracting entities and relationships from text related to the Bhagavad Gita. The file contains the following:\n\n1. A description of the task and the expected output format.\n2. A list of entity types that can be extracted, such as DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, and TEACHING.\n3. An example text and its corresponding output, illustrating the expected format and content of the entities and relationships.\n4. A real data section containing the actual text from the Bhagavad Gita, along with an expected output for that text.\n5. Two additional prompts:\n\t* `CONTINUE_PROMPT`: Asking the model to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n\t* `LOOP_PROMPT`: Asking the model to confirm whether there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage. The model should respond with either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nOverall, this file provides a clear definition of the task, the expected output format, and the real data to be processed, which can be used to train a machine learning model for entity extraction and relationship identification.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Now learn of these from Me.\n The place of action [the body], the performer, the various senses, the many different kinds of endeavor, and ultimately the Supersoul – these are the five factors of action.\n Whatever right or wrong action a man performs by body, mind or speech is caused by these five factors.\n Therefore one who thinks himself the only doer, not considering the five factors, is certainly not very intelligent and cannot see things as they are.\n One who is not motivated by false ego, whose intelligence is not entangled, though he kills men in this world, does not kill. Nor is he bound by his actions.\n Knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower are the three factors that motivate action; the senses, the work and the doer are the three constituents of action.\n According to the three different modes of material nature, there are three kinds of knowledge, action and performer of action. Now hear of them from Me.\n That knowledge by which one undivided spiritual nature is seen in all living entities, though they are divided into innumerable forms, you should understand to be in the mode of goodness.\n That knowledge by which one sees that in every different body there is a different type of living entity you should understand to be in the mode of passion.\n And that knowledge by which one is attached to one kind of work as the all in all, without knowledge of the truth,\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
