{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task, specifically designed for extracting entities and relationships from text related to the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture. \n\nThe file consists of three main sections: GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT, CONTINUE_PROMPT, and LOOP_PROMPT.\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT outlines the task objective, which is to extract entities and relationships from a given text passage that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth of the Bhagavad Gita. The prompt provides a detailed guidance on the expected output format, specifically:\n\n* Entities: include the entity name, type, and detailed description.\n* Relationships: include the source entity, target entity, relationship description, and relationship strength score.\n\nExample 1 and Example 2 provide illustrations of expected outputs for two different text passages. Real Data section includes text and potential entities and relationships for manual review and comparison.\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT encourages the user to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n\nLOOP_PROMPT asks if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage, and prompts the user to answer YES or NO.\n\nThis script appears to be designed for human validation and manual review, providing a stepping stone for NLP models to understand the philosophical and symbolic content of the Bhagavad Gita.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

However, one of them tends to be stronger and it becomes the nature of a person. Know that strong knowledge of God increases Sattva and leads to happiness. When Rajas becomes strong, the person experiences greed, restlessness, and a desire for more. When Tamas becomes strong, delusion and lack of action are dominant.\n\nA successful person is one who tries to rise over all these three gunas. Such a person has knowledge of God and knows everything exists because of God. Such a person is liberated and attains God.\n\nThe above is the summary of Bhagavad Gita, chapter 14. The next chapter discusses the nature of the Supreme Being.One should seek refuge in the Original Being, from whom this eternal process of creation and destruction started. A person who lives without pride and delusion, without attachment, immerses himself in the knowledge of the soul, free of happiness and unhappiness, such a person goes to God, the indestructible goal.\n\nLord Krishna tells Arjuna that He is the energy that lights up the sun, moon, and fire. He is the fire of digestion in individual bodies and helps digest food. He is the knower of Vedas and the origin of Vedanta.\n\nThe people who know Him to be the Supreme Being, are omniscient and worship Him in every way possible.\n\nThis is a\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
