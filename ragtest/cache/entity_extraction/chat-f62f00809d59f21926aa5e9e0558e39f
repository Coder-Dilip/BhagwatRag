The prompt is divided into several sections:\n\n1. **Goal**: The purpose of the exercise is to extract meaningful entities and relationships from the text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n2. **Steps**: The user is instructed to identify entities, extract entity information, identify related entities, extract relationship information, and then return the output in a specific format.\n3. **Examples**: Two examples are provided, demonstrating how to extract entities and relationships from texts.\n4. **Real Data**: The prompt provides sample text from the Bhagavad Gita, along with expected output for the entities and relationships.\n5. **CONTINUE_PROMPT**: A reminder to continue extracting concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n6. **LOOP_PROMPT**: A loop that continues asking the user if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage.\n\nThe prompt is designed to facilitate the extraction of meaningful entities and relationships from the Bhagavad Gita, allowing users to gain a deeper understanding of the philosophical and symbolic themes within the text.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. He explains the nature of duty, selflessness, and the eternal soul.\n######################\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>KRISHNA<|>DEITY<|>Krishna is the supreme deity who provides wisdom and guidance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARJUNA<|>PERSON<|>A warrior seeking guidance on duty and life)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUTY<|>CONCEPT<|>The principle of fulfilling one's responsibilities without attachment to outcomes)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KRISHNA<|>ARJUNA<|>Krishna guides Arjuna in understanding his duty<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KRISHNA<|>DUTY<|>Krishna imparts the concept of duty as essential for spiritual growth<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\nExample 2:\nText:\nArjuna experiences intense inner conflict, torn between his warrior duty and his compassion for family members on the opposing side.\n######################\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>ARJUNA<|>PERSON<|>Arjuna is a warrior experiencing moral and emotional conflict)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUTY<|>CONCEPT<|>The concept of duty as Arjuna’s responsibility as a warrior)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPASSION<|>VIRTUE<|>A virtue that causes Arjuna emotional turmoil on the battlefield)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUTY<|>COMPASSION<|>Duty and compassion create an inner conflict within Arjuna<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Real Data-\n######################\nEntity_types: DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING\nText: solitary place; detachment from the general mass of people; accepting the importance of self-realization; and philosophical search for the Absolute Truth – all these I declare to be knowledge, and besides this whatever there may be is ignorance.\n I shall now explain the knowable, knowing which you will taste the eternal. Brahman, the spirit, beginningless and subordinate to Me, lies beyond the cause and effect of this material world.\n Everywhere are His hands and legs, His eyes, heads and faces, and He has ears everywhere. In this way the Supersoul exists, pervading everything.\n The Supersoul is the original source of all senses, yet He is without senses. He is unattached, although He is the maintainer of all living beings. He transcends the modes of nature, and at the same time He is the master of all the modes of material nature.\n The Supreme Truth exists outside and inside of all living beings, the moving and the nonmoving. Because He is subtle, He is beyond the power of the material senses to see or to know. Although far, far away, He is also near to all.\n Although the Supersoul appears to be divided among all beings, He is never divided. He is situated as one. Although He is the maintainer of every living entity, it is to be understood that He devours and develops all.\n He is the source of light in all luminous objects. He is beyond the darkness of matter and is unmanifest\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
