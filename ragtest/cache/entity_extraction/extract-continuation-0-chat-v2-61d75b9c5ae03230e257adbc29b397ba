Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

The main takeaway is that everyone worships the same God and whoever is devoted to God, attains God instead of having to be reborn.\nThe teachings from this chapter of Bhagavad Gita go on to show how great God is. It highlights Him in the different objects – living and non-living. For example, Lord Krishna says to Arjuna that He is the Sun among all the shining objects, the moon among the stars (since the moon is brighter compared to distant stars), and so on.\n\nGod says the person who knows Him without having an origin and end, without birth and death, as the greatest Lord of the worlds, such a person is free from delusion and freed from sins. Lord Krishna teaches Arjuna saying He is the origin of everything. The wise know this fact and worship Him, immersed in devotion. To such people, God imparts divine Yoga, knowing which, they attain Him.\n\nThe rest of the chapter is highlighting God among objects as stated above. Some verses are Arjuna praising Lord Krishna. The Lord concludes this chapter by saying everything movable and immovable comes into existence only because of His Grace.\n\nThe summary of Bhagavad Gita, chapter ten, is that God is the best and everything in this world is because of Him.
