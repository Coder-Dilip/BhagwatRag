Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Through them lust covers the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him.\n Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bhāratas, in the very beginning curb this great symbol of sin [lust] by regulating the senses, and slay this destroyer of knowledge and self-realization.\n The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he [the soul] is even higher than the intelligence.\n Thus knowing oneself to be transcendental\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?

The prompts are specifically designed for a task related to the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture that contains philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references.\n\nThe task involves the following steps:\n\n1. Identifying entities: The user needs to identify entities in the text, define their types (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, etc.), and provide a detailed description of each entity's attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications.\n2. Identifying relationships between entities: The user needs to identify pairs of entities that are clearly related to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way, and extract information about the relationship, including the relationship description, strength, and relevance.\n3. Outputting entities and relationships: The user needs to format the entities and relationships in a specific format, using a delimiter (##), and output them as a single list.\n\nThe file provides an example of how the output should look like, as well as a real data section that includes a text passage and its corresponding output. Additionally, there are two prompts that can be used as follows:\n\n* `CONTINUE_PROMPT`: This prompt is intended for continuing the analysis and adding any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n* `LOOP_PROMPT`: This prompt is used to check if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage. The user needs to answer YES or NO to this prompt.\n\nOverall, this file provides a structured prompt for a task that involves the analysis of a philosophical text and the extraction of entities and relationships."}]}
