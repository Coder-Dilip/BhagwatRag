{"result": "This is a text prompt for a task that requires the extraction of entities and relationships from a given text passage, specifically a passage from the Bhagavad Gita. The task involves identifying entities related to spirituality, morality, and existence, and then identifying relationships between these entities.\n\nThe prompt provides the following instructions:\n\n1. Identify all entities in the text, including concepts, deities, persons, virtues, emotions, mindsets, actions, and teachings. For each entity, extract the following information:\n\t* Entity name (capitalized)\n\t* Entity type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, etc.)\n\t* Entity description (a detailed description of the entity's attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications)\n2. Identify pairs of related entities that are clearly connected in a philosophical or symbolic way. For each pair, extract the following information:\n\t* Source entity name\n\t* Target entity name\n\t* Relationship description (an explanation of how the source and target entities are related)\n\t* Relationship strength (a numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship)\n3. Organize the entities and relationships into a list, using **##** as the list delimiter.\n4. When finished, output \"**|COMPLETE|**\".\n5. The text provides an example output format for entities and relationships.\n\nThe CONTINUE_PROMPT and LOOP_PROMPT are additional instructions to provide guidance on how to approach the task:\n\n* CONTINUE_PROMPT encourages the user to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n* LOOP_PROMPT asks the user if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage. The user is prompted to answer \"YES\" or \"NO\" to this question.\n\nOverall, this prompt requires a deep understanding of the Bhagavad Gita and its philosophical themes, as well as the ability to identify and extract relevant entities and relationships from the text.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.
