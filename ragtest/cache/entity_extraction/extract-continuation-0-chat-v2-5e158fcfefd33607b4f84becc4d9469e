Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

O unconquerable Lord, You engage Your illusory energy, composed of three modes, to unleash, maintain\nand devastate the inconceivable manifest cosmos, all within Your own self. As the supreme superintendent\nof maya, You appear to be situated in the interaction of the modes of nature; however, You are never\naffected by material activities. In fact, You are directly engaged in Your own eternal, spiritual bliss, and thus\nYou cannot be accused of any material infection.\n9. O greatest of all, those whose consciousness is polluted by illusion cannot purify themselves merely by\nordinary worship, study of the Vedas, charity, austerity and ritual activities. Our Lord, those pure souls who\nhave developed a powerful transcendental faith in Your glories achieve a purified state of existence that can\nnever be attained by those lacking such faith.\n10. Great sages, desiring the highest benefit in life, always cherish Your lotus feet within their hearts, which\nare melted by love for You. Similarly, Your self-controlled devotees, desiring to cross beyond the material\nkingdom of heaven to achieve opulence equal to Yours, worship Your lotus feet in the morning, at noon and\nin the evening. Thus, they meditate upon Your Lordship in Your quadruple expansion. Your lotus feet are\njust like a blazing fire that burns to ashes all the inauspicious desires for material sense gratification.\n11.\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
