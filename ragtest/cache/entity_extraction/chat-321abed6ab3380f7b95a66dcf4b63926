{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) task. The prompt is designed to extract entities and relationships from a given text passage, specifically focusing on the philosophical and symbolic themes present in the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe prompt outlines four main steps:\n\n1. Identifying entities: The system is asked to identify entities in the text, including concepts, deities, people, virtues, emotions, mindsets, actions, teachings, and others. For each entity, the system is expected to extract information such as name, type, and description.\n2. Identifying relationships: Once entities are identified, the system is asked to identify pairs of entities that are related to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way. For each relationship, the system is expected to extract information such as the source and target entities, the relationship description, and the relationship strength.\n3. Outputting entities and relationships: The system is expected to return a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2, separated by the delimiter **##**.\n4. Completing the task: The system is asked to output \"<|COMPLETE|>\" when the task is finished.\n\nThe prompt also provides two example outputs, Example 1 and Example 2, to illustrate the expected format and content of the output.\n\nThe \"CONTINUE_PROMPT\" is a supplementary prompt that allows the user to add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that may further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n\nThe \"LOOP_PROMPT\" is a follow-up prompt that asks the user if they would like to continue adding entities and relationships. The user can respond with either \"YES\" or \"NO\" to indicate whether they would like to continue or stop the task.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n######################\n-Examples-\n######################\nExample 1:\nText:\nKrishna, the supreme deity, guides Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

The calmness of mind, absence of cruelty, and purity in attitude are known as mental austerities. These three types of austerities are of Sattva type. Austerities taken up for praise, respect, or worship are of Rajas type. Austerities that lead to pain and destruction of others are of Tamas type.\n\nGod, the Creator, is described as Om Tat Sat in ancient texts. The Vedas are said to be created from these three words (“Om Tat Sat”). Therefore, every auspicious ritual is carried out after uttering the word “Om”. People who desire liberation, give up worldly attachments after uttering “Tat”. The word “Sat” is used for performing auspicious acts like prayers, sacrifices (yajnas), and donations.\n\nThus ends the summary ofBhagavad Gita, chapter 17. The main teachings of Sri Krishna in this chapter are that people should strengthen their Sattva quality and after that, rise above the three gunas to find liberation.\nThis is the longest chapter and sums up the entireBhagavad Gita. Lord Krishna’s teachings in this chapter cover different yogas, again action (karma yoga) and sanyassa yoga (renunciation), etc.\n\nA person who gives up all materialistic desires is a sanyasi (one who has ren\n######################\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n\nCONTINUE_PROMPT = \"Add any remaining concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\\n\"\nLOOP_PROMPT = \"Are there additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in this passage?
