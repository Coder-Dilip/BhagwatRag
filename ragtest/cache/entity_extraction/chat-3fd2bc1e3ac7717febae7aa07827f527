{"result": "This file appears to provide a set of prompts for a text-based information extraction task. The goal of the task is to extract entities and relationships from a passage of text inspired by the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the prompts:\n\n1. **GRAPH EXTRACTION PROMPT**: This prompt defines the task and provides instructions on how to extract entities and relationships from the text. It specifies the types of entities to look for (DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING), and the format for outputting the extracted entities and relationships.\n2. **CONTINUE_PROMPT**: This prompt is used to encourage the extractor to continue adding concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text.\n3. **LOOP_PROMPT**: This prompt is used to loop the extractor back to the previous question and ask if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage. The user is prompted to answer YES or NO.\n\nThe output of the task is a list of extracted entities and relationships, with each entity represented by a string in the format `\"entity\"|<entity_name>|<entity_type>|<entity_description>` and each relationship represented by a string in the format `\"relationship\"|<source_entity>|<target_entity>|<relationship_description>|<relationship_strength>`. The output is separated by `##` delimiters and ends with the string `<|COMPLETE|>`.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The seat should be neither too high nor too low and should be situated in a sacred place. The yogī should then sit on it very firmly and practice yoga to purify the heart by controlling his mind, senses and activities and fixing the mind on one point.\n-14: One should hold one’s body, neck and head erect in a straight line and stare steadily at the tip of the nose.
