{"result": "This is a prompt definition file for a task that involves extracting entities and relationships from a given text, specifically from the Bhagavad Gita. The task is to identify entities such as concepts, deities, persons, virtues, emotions, mindsets, actions, and teachings, and then identify relationships between these entities that are philosophically or symbolically significant.\n\nThe prompt provides a detailed explanation of the task, including the types of entities to look for, the information to extract for each entity, and the format for the output. It also provides examples of how the output should look like.\n\nThe prompt is divided into four main sections:\n\n1. **Goal**: This section explains the purpose of the task and the types of entities to look for.\n2. **Steps**: This section outlines the steps to follow to complete the task, including identifying entities, extracting information about each entity, and identifying relationships between entities.\n3. **Examples**: This section provides two examples of how the output should look like, with a sample text and the corresponding output.\n4. **Real Data**: This section provides a sample text and the expected output for that text.\n\nThe CONTINUE_PROMPT and LOOP_PROMPT are used to guide the user through the task, asking if they want to continue adding concepts, symbols, or entities that further clarify the philosophical and symbolic relationships within the text, and if there are additional entities or relationships that might add depth or uncover further philosophical insights in the passage.", "input": "# Copyright (c) 2024 Microsoft Corporation.\n# Licensed under the MIT License\n\n\"\"\"A file containing prompts definition.\"\"\"\n\nGRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n-Goal-\nThe text provided is from or inspired by the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture that conveys deep philosophical teachings, dialogues, and symbolic references. Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.
