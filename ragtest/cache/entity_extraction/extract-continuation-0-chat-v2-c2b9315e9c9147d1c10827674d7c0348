Your task is to extract meaningful entities and relationships within this text that capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth.\n\nEntities should reflect the spiritual, moral, and existential themes present in the *Bhagavad Gita*. Common types of entities include, but are not limited to, concepts such as duty, virtue, emotions, deities, teachings, and mindsets. You may also identify any other types that align with the philosophical or symbolic themes of the text. Use your understanding to label entities with appropriate types based on their roles or meanings within the context of the text.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Based on the philosophical or symbolic role, choose an appropriate type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, VIRTUE, EMOTION, MINDSET, ACTION, TEACHING, or another relevant type that fits the context of the *Bhagavad Gita*).\n- entity_description: Detailed description of the entity’s attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications. Include interpretations where relevant.\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: Explanation of how the source and target entities are philosophically or symbolically related, including causal, representational, or contrastive meanings where applicable.\n- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship between the entities, where 10 represents a foundational relationship, 5-9 an important symbolic or causal link, and 1-4 a minor or interpretative connection.\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The saintly brahmana said: O King, the embodied living entity automatically experiences unhappiness in\nheaven or hell. Similarly, happiness will also be experienced, even without one’s seeking it. Therefore a\nperson of intelligent discrimination does not make any endeavor to obtain such material happiness.\n2. Following the example of the python, one should give up material endeavors and accept for one’s\nmaintenance food that comes of its own accord, whether such food be delicious or tasteless, ample or\nmeager.\n3. If at any time food does not come, then a saintly person should fast for many days without making\nendeavor. He should understand that by God’s arrangement he must fast. Thus, following the example of the\npython, he should remain peaceful and patient.\n4. A saintly person should remain peaceful and materially inactive, maintaining his body without much\nendeavor. Even though possessed of full sensual, mental and physical strength, a saintly person should not\nbecome active for material gain but rather should always remain alert to his actual self-interest.\n5. A saintly sage is happy and pleasing in his external behavior, whereas internally he is most grave and\nthoughtful. Because his knowledge is immeasurable and unlimited he is never disturbed, and thus in all\nrespects he is like the tranquil waters of the unfathomable and unsurpassable ocean.\n6.

The prompts are designed to help users identify and extract meaningful entities and relationships within the text, which can be used to capture the philosophical essence, symbolic meaning, and relational depth of the text.\n\nThe prompts are structured into several steps:\n\n1. **Identify entities**: Users are asked to identify all entities in the text, including concepts, deities, persons, virtues, emotions, mindsets, actions, and teachings. For each entity, users are required to extract the entity name, type (e.g., DEITY, PERSON, CONCEPT, etc.), and a detailed description of the entity's attributes, symbolism, and philosophical implications.\n2. **Identify relationships**: Users are asked to identify pairs of entities that are clearly related to each other in a philosophical or symbolic way. For each pair of related entities, users are required to extract the source entity, target entity, relationship description, and relationship strength (a numeric score indicating the philosophical significance of the relationship).\n3. **Return output**: Users are required to return a single list of all entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2, using **##** as the list delimiter.\n\nThe prompts also include examples and real data to illustrate the expected output format. The CONTINUE_PROMPT and LOOP_PROMPT are additional prompts that encourage users to continue analyzing the text and identifying more entities and relationships to add depth and uncover further philosophical insights.\n\nOverall, these prompts provide a clear and structured framework for analyzing the Bhagavad Gita and identifying its key themes, concepts, and relationships, which can be used for a variety of purposes, such as exploring philosophical insights, analyzing cultural significance, or creating educational materials."}]}
