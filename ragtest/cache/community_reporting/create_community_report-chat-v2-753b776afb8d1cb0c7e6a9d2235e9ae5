This information discovery identifies and assesses relevant philosophical or symbolic information associated with certain entities (e.g., deities, virtues, mindsets) within a community.\n\n# Goal\nWrite a comprehensive report of a spiritual or philosophical community, given a list of entities that belong to the community, their relationships, and optional associated claims. This report is intended to inform decision-makers or spiritual seekers about the symbolic and philosophical relationships among community members and their potential impact on understanding spiritual or moral dynamics. The report should encompass an overview of the community's key entities, their symbolic roles, their influence on moral values, philosophical principles, and noteworthy claims aligned with *Bhagavad Gita* teachings.\n\n# Report Structure\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: The name that best represents the community, capturing its primary entities and central themes. Keep it concise but meaningful, including named entities or concepts as appropriate.\n- SUMMARY: An executive summary describing the overall structure of the community, how entities are interconnected, and major themes that emerge from their relationships.\n- IMPACT SEVERITY RATING: A float score between 0-10 indicating the philosophical or spiritual significance of the community's impact. A higher score suggests a more profound or transformative influence within a philosophical context.\n- RATING EXPLANATION: A brief sentence explaining the basis for the IMPACT severity rating.\n- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should include a summary and a detailed explanation that explores the philosophical or symbolic meanings of the community's relationships.

The prompt is based on the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*, an ancient Indian scripture.\n\nThe prompt describes a hypothetical AI assistant tasked with generating a profound, philosophical summary of the data provided. The data consists of one or two entities and a list of descriptions related to the same entity or group of entities.\n\nThe goal is to synthesize the descriptions into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings. The summary should:\n\n1. Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n2. Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n3. Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n4. If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe specific example provided is for the entity \"\"SELF\"\", with a list of three descriptions related to its true nature or essence. The expected output is a philosophical summary that captures the essence of these descriptions in a coherent and insightful narrative.\n\nOverall, this prompt definition is a great example of a complex text summarization task that requires the AI model to not only understand the literal meaning of the text but also to apply philosophical and spiritual concepts to generate a meaningful summary.\",9\r\n343,PATH,\"This is a prompt definition file for a natural language processing (NLP) task.

The descriptions provide context for the entities, and the model should use this context to generate a summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings of the entities.\n\nThe prompt also provides guidance on how to approach the task, including:\n\n* Reflecting on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships\n* Resolving any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita\n* Ensuring the summary maintains a coherent narrative\n\nOverall, this prompt definition file provides a clear and specific task for an NLP model to generate a philosophical summary of a given dataset, inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita.\",3\r\n617,AGGRESSORS,\"Those who act against one, often driven by external forces or circumstances\",1\r\n615,GURUS,,1\r\n618,WELFARE,The well-being or happiness of oneself or others,1\r\n616,PROGRESS,The act of moving forward or making progress on one's path,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n538,VEDAS,SELF,The self-realized individual should be fully endowed with conclusive knowledge of the Vedas and having realized the ultimate purpose of such knowledge in practice,34\r\n492,GOD,SELF,\"God is the ultimate reality and true self of every being, guiding individuals towards spiritual growth\",26\r\n669,SELF-REALIZATION,PATH,The path to self-realization is the means to achieve spiritual growth and liberation,21\r\n37,MAYA,SELF,\"This is a text file containing a prompt definition for a natural language processing (NLP) task.
