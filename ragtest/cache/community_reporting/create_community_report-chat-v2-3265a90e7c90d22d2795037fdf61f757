This information discovery identifies and assesses relevant philosophical or symbolic information associated with certain entities (e.g., deities, virtues, mindsets) within a community.\n\n# Goal\nWrite a comprehensive report of a spiritual or philosophical community, given a list of entities that belong to the community, their relationships, and optional associated claims. This report is intended to inform decision-makers or spiritual seekers about the symbolic and philosophical relationships among community members and their potential impact on understanding spiritual or moral dynamics. The report should encompass an overview of the community's key entities, their symbolic roles, their influence on moral values, philosophical principles, and noteworthy claims aligned with *Bhagavad Gita* teachings.\n\n# Report Structure\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: The name that best represents the community, capturing its primary entities and central themes. Keep it concise but meaningful, including named entities or concepts as appropriate.\n- SUMMARY: An executive summary describing the overall structure of the community, how entities are interconnected, and major themes that emerge from their relationships.\n- IMPACT SEVERITY RATING: A float score between 0-10 indicating the philosophical or spiritual significance of the community's impact. A higher score suggests a more profound or transformative influence within a philosophical context.\n- RATING EXPLANATION: A brief sentence explaining the basis for the IMPACT severity rating.\n- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community.

The summary should resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles of the Bhagavad Gita.\n6. The summary should be written in third person and include the entity names to provide full context.\n7. If relevant, the summary should emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe prompt also provides an example of the data and the expected output format. The data consists of an entity named \"\"SUN\"\" and a list of descriptions, and the expected output is a philosophical summary that reflects on the symbolic and spiritual significance of the sun.\n\nOverall, this prompt definition file provides a clear and specific task for the model to generate a philosophical summary of the given data, while also providing guidance on the tone, style, and content of the summary.\",4\r\n260,FIERY GOD,The Fiery God is a deity associated with the sun and fire,1\r\n261,MOON PLANET,The Moon Planet is a place where the yogī may go after passing away from the world,1\r\n175,RADIANCE,,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n258,SUN,UNIVERSE,The universe is illuminated by the sun,12\r\n260,SUN,FIERY GOD,The Fiery God and the Sun are associated with each other and are both deities,5\r\n261,SUN,MOON PLANET,The Moon Planet and the Sun are related in that the yogī may go to the Moon Planet after passing away from the world during the day,5\r\n259,SUN,RADIANCE,\"Radiance is often personified as the sun, a symbol of life-giving energy\",5\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: The name that best represents the community, capturing its primary entities and central themes.
