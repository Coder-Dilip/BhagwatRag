This information discovery identifies and assesses relevant philosophical or symbolic information associated with certain entities (e.g., deities, virtues, mindsets) within a community.\n\n# Goal\nWrite a comprehensive report of a spiritual or philosophical community, given a list of entities that belong to the community, their relationships, and optional associated claims. This report is intended to inform decision-makers or spiritual seekers about the symbolic and philosophical relationships among community members and their potential impact on understanding spiritual or moral dynamics. The report should encompass an overview of the community's key entities, their symbolic roles, their influence on moral values, philosophical principles, and noteworthy claims aligned with *Bhagavad Gita* teachings.\n\n# Report Structure\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: The name that best represents the community, capturing its primary entities and central themes. Keep it concise but meaningful, including named entities or concepts as appropriate.\n- SUMMARY: An executive summary describing the overall structure of the community, how entities are interconnected, and major themes that emerge from their relationships.\n- IMPACT SEVERITY RATING: A float score between 0-10 indicating the philosophical or spiritual significance of the community's impact. A higher score suggests a more profound or transformative influence within a philosophical context.\n- RATING EXPLANATION: A brief sentence explaining the basis for the IMPACT severity rating.\n- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community.

The prompt is asking the AI model to generate a philosophical summary of a given dataset, inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe prompt provides a clear outline of the task, including:\n\n1. The goal: to generate a profound, philosophical summary of the data.\n2. The context: the data consists of one or two entities and a list of descriptions related to those entities.\n3. The requirements:\n\t* Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n\t* Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\t* Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n\t* If relevant, emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe prompt also provides an example dataset, which consists of two entities (\"\"SIN\"\") and a list of descriptions. The output is expected to be a summary that captures the literal and symbolic meanings of the data, reflecting the philosophical and spiritual themes of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nOverall, this prompt definition file provides a clear and specific task for the AI model to generate a high-quality summary that meets the requirements and expectations.\",5\r\n395,KINSMEN,Kinsmen refer to the family members and friends one is expected to protect,2\r\n75,DEVOTEES,,1\r\n71,THIEF,A person who enjoys gifts without reciprocating with sacrifices is considered a thief,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n154,SIN,DHṚTARĀṢṬRA,Dhṛtarāṣṭra's sons are the aggressors who will lead to sin if killed,10\r\n155,SIN,KINSMEN,Killing one's kinsmen leads to sin and destruction of the family tradition,7\r\n454,DHṚTARĀṢṬRA,KINSMEN,Dhṛtarāṣṭra's sons are his kinsmen and friends he wants to protect,7\r\n152,SIN,PERFORMANCE_OF_YAJÑA,Performance of sacrifice is essential to avoid sin,7\r\n153,SIN,DEVOTEES,The devotees are released from sin by eating food offered in sacrifice,6\r\n151,THIEF,SIN,The thief is guilty of sin,6\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: The name that best represents the community, capturing its primary entities and central themes.
