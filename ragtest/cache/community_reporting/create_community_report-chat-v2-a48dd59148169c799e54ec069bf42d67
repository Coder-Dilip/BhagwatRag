This information discovery identifies and assesses relevant philosophical or symbolic information associated with certain entities (e.g., deities, virtues, mindsets) within a community.\n\n# Goal\nWrite a comprehensive report of a spiritual or philosophical community, given a list of entities that belong to the community, their relationships, and optional associated claims. This report is intended to inform decision-makers or spiritual seekers about the symbolic and philosophical relationships among community members and their potential impact on understanding spiritual or moral dynamics. The report should encompass an overview of the community's key entities, their symbolic roles, their influence on moral values, philosophical principles, and noteworthy claims aligned with *Bhagavad Gita* teachings.\n\n# Report Structure\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: The name that best represents the community, capturing its primary entities and central themes. Keep it concise but meaningful, including named entities or concepts as appropriate.\n- SUMMARY: An executive summary describing the overall structure of the community, how entities are interconnected, and major themes that emerge from their relationships.\n- IMPACT SEVERITY RATING: A float score between 0-10 indicating the philosophical or spiritual significance of the community's impact. A higher score suggests a more profound or transformative influence within a philosophical context.\n- RATING EXPLANATION: A brief sentence explaining the basis for the IMPACT severity rating.\n- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community.

The prompt is asking a model to generate a philosophical summary of a given dataset, inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita. The goal is to synthesize the descriptions of one or two entities and their relationships into a single, insightful summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nThe prompt provides specific guidelines for the summary, including:\n\n1. Reflecting on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n2. Resolving any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita.\n3. Ensuring the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n4. Emphasizing concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe prompt also provides a specific example of the type of data that the model should be able to process, including the entity \"\"KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS\"\" and a list of descriptions related to it. The output is expected to be a philosophical summary of the entity and its descriptions, written in a coherent and insightful manner.\",2\r\n387,ORDINARY RELIGIOUS DUTIES,The duties prescribed by the Vedic scriptures that purify the performer,1\r\n272,BHAGAVAD GITA AS IT IS,A book that presents the teachings of Bhagavad Gita in a practical way>,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n407,KRISHNA,SAINLY PERSON,Krishna is the shelter and guide for a saintly person,63\r\n611,KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS,SAINLY PERSON,A saintly person revives the Krsna consciousness of others,5\r\n720,ORDINARY RELIGIOUS DUTIES,SAINLY PERSON,A saintly person renounces ordinary religious duties and worships Krishna alone,4\r\n610,BHAGAVAD GITA AS IT IS,KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS,Krishna consciousness movement is based on the teachings of Bhagavad Gita,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: The name that best represents the community, capturing its primary entities and central themes.
