The prompt is asking a model to generate a philosophical summary of a given dataset, inspired by the themes of the Bhagavad Gita. The goal is to synthesize the descriptions of two entities, JIVA and SANATANA, into a single summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings.\n\nThe prompt provides specific guidelines for the summary, including:\n\n1. Reflecting on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n2. Resolving any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the Bhagavad Gita.\n3. Ensuring the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n4. Emphasizing concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe prompt also provides a sample dataset, which includes two entities, JIVA and SANATANA, and a list of descriptions related to these entities. The output is expected to be a single summary that captures the essence of the dataset.\n\nOverall, this prompt definition file is asking the model to generate a thoughtful and insightful summary that not only summarizes the given data but also provides a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and themes.\",8\r\n154,MIND,VITAL ENERGY,\"Vital energy and mind are performed without material desire, indicating detachment from worldly attachments\",8\r\n79,BEE,HUNTER,The hunter takes advantage of the bee's labor,7\r\n76,GREED,BEE,The bee's industry is driven by greed,7\r\n855,HEAVEN,POOR MALE PIGEON,The speaker's wife and children have gone to heaven,7\r\n712,INTELLIGENCE,VITAL ENERGY,\"Vital energy and intelligence are performed without material desire, indicating detachment from worldly attachments\",7\r\n707,SENSES,OBJECTS,The senses contact sense objects born of the modes of nature,7\r\n852,NET,CHILDREN,\"The children are trapped in the hunter's net, symbolizing the limitations and dangers of the material world\",6\r\n80,HUNTER,DEER,The deer is vulnerable to the hunter's trap,6\r\n92,PINGALA,HOME,\"Pingala remains at home, waiting for customers\",6\r\n713,INTELLIGENCE,HUMAN LIFE,Intelligence is necessary for realizing the importance of human life,6\r\n151,MATERIAL DESIRE,LOVERS,Attachment to lovers is a material desire and a cause of unhappiness,6\r\n91,PINGALA,LOVER,Pingala's desire for a lover to satisfy her needs,5\r\n631,PRĀKRITI,WIFE,\"Prakṛti is compared to a wife, illustrating the subordinate relationship between prakṛti and the Lord\",5\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: The name that best represents the community, capturing its primary entities and central themes.
