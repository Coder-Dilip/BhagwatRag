The summary should be inspired by the themes of the *Bhagavad Gita*, a Hindu scripture that explores the nature of the self, the soul, and the duties of individuals towards others and towards the divine.\n2. The summary should reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships described.\n3. It should resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles found within the *Bhagavad Gita*.\n4. The summary should maintain a coherent narrative, written in third person, and include the entity names to provide full context.\n5. If relevant, it should emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe data provided consists of two entities (\"\"VIṣṇu\"\") and a list of descriptions related to these entities.
