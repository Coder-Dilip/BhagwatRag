This information discovery identifies and assesses relevant philosophical or symbolic information associated with certain entities (e.g., deities, virtues, mindsets) within a community.\n\n# Goal\nWrite a comprehensive report of a spiritual or philosophical community, given a list of entities that belong to the community, their relationships, and optional associated claims. This report is intended to inform decision-makers or spiritual seekers about the symbolic and philosophical relationships among community members and their potential impact on understanding spiritual or moral dynamics. The report should encompass an overview of the community's key entities, their symbolic roles, their influence on moral values, philosophical principles, and noteworthy claims aligned with *Bhagavad Gita* teachings.\n\n# Report Structure\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: The name that best represents the community, capturing its primary entities and central themes. Keep it concise but meaningful, including named entities or concepts as appropriate.\n- SUMMARY: An executive summary describing the overall structure of the community, how entities are interconnected, and major themes that emerge from their relationships.\n- IMPACT SEVERITY RATING: A float score between 0-10 indicating the philosophical or spiritual significance of the community's impact. A higher score suggests a more profound or transformative influence within a philosophical context.\n- RATING EXPLANATION: A brief sentence explaining the basis for the IMPACT severity rating.\n- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community.

The script starts with a copyright notice and a license statement, indicating that the author is granting permission to use the code under the terms of the MIT License.\n2. The script appears to be defining a prompt for a natural language processing (NLP) task. The prompt is asking for a summary of data provided about entities related to Vedic knowledge.\n3. The prompt is quite detailed, providing guidelines for the summary. It asks the AI to:\n\t* Generate a profound and philosophical summary inspired by the Bhagavad Gita.\n\t* Reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n\t* Resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\t* Ensure the summary maintains a coherent narrative, written in third person, and includes the entity names to provide full context.\n\t* Highlight concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, and interpret the descriptions in a way that emphasizes deeper spiritual significance.\n4. The script provides sample data for the AI to work with. In this case, the entities are \"\"VEDIC KNOWLEDGE\"\", and there is a list of descriptions related to this entity. The descriptions include phrases like \"\"Vedic knowledge is received from transcendental sources and is perfect and all-pervading\"\" and \"\"Vedic knowledge is the authority that confirms Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead\"\".\n\nOverall, this script seems to be designed to assess the ability of an AI model to generate a thoughtful and philosophical summary of complex data, while also demonstrating an understanding of certain spiritual and philosophical concepts.\",4\r\n276,ŚRĪ KṚṢṆA,\"This is a text file that defines a prompt for generating a philosophical summary of a given data set.

The assistant should synthesize the provided descriptions into a single summary that captures both the literal and symbolic meanings of the entities.\n2. The summary should reflect on the philosophical, spiritual, or moral implications of the entities and relationships.\n3. The assistant should resolve any contradictions thoughtfully, favoring interpretations that align with the teachings and principles of the Bhagavad Gita.\n4. The summary should maintain a coherent narrative, written in third person, and include the entity names to provide full context.\n5. The assistant should emphasize concepts such as duty, virtue, the self, and the soul, interpreting the descriptions in a way that highlights deeper spiritual significance.\n\nThe prompt also includes an example of data that should be processed, which consists of an entity name (\"\"Śrī Kṛṣṇa\"\") and a description (\"\"Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the speaker of the Bhagavad Gita\"\").
