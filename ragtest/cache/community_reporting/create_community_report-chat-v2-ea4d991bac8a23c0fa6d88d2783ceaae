This information discovery identifies and assesses relevant philosophical or symbolic information associated with certain entities (e.g., deities, virtues, mindsets) within a community.\n\n# Goal\nWrite a comprehensive report of a spiritual or philosophical community, given a list of entities that belong to the community, their relationships, and optional associated claims. This report is intended to inform decision-makers or spiritual seekers about the symbolic and philosophical relationships among community members and their potential impact on understanding spiritual or moral dynamics. The report should encompass an overview of the community's key entities, their symbolic roles, their influence on moral values, philosophical principles, and noteworthy claims aligned with *Bhagavad Gita* teachings.\n\n# Report Structure\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: The name that best represents the community, capturing its primary entities and central themes. Keep it concise but meaningful, including named entities or concepts as appropriate.\n- SUMMARY: An executive summary describing the overall structure of the community, how entities are interconnected, and major themes that emerge from their relationships.\n- IMPACT SEVERITY RATING: A float score between 0-10 indicating the philosophical or spiritual significance of the community's impact. A higher score suggests a more profound or transformative influence within a philosophical context.\n- RATING EXPLANATION: A brief sentence explaining the basis for the IMPACT severity rating.\n- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community.
